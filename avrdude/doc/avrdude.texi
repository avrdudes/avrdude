@cindex introduction

AVRDUDE - AVR Downloader Uploader - is a program for downloading and
uploading the on-chip memories of Atmel's AVR microcontrollers. It can
program the Flash and EEPROM, and where supported by the serial
programming protocol, it can program fuse and lock bits. AVRDUDE also
supplies a direct instruction mode allowing one to issue any programming
instruction to the AVR chip regardless of whether AVRDUDE implements
that specific feature of a particular chip.

AVRDUDE can be used effectively via the command line to read or write
all chip memory types (eeprom, flash, fuse bits, lock bits, signature
bytes) or via an interactive (terminal) mode. Using AVRDUDE from the
command line works well for programming the entire memory of the chip
from the contents of a file, while interactive mode is useful for
exploring memory contents, modifing individual bytes of eeprom,
programming fuse/lock bits, etc.

AVRDUDE supports the following basic programmer types: Atmel's STK500,
Atmel's AVRISP and AVRISP mkII devices,
Atmel's STK600,
Atmel's JTAG ICE (both mkI and mkII, the latter also in ISP mode), appnote
avr910, appnote avr109 (including the AVR Butterfly),
serial bit-bang adapters,
and the PPI (parallel port interface). PPI represents a class
of simple programmers where the programming lines are directly
connected to the PC parallel port. Several pin configurations exist
for several variations of the PPI programmers, and AVRDUDE can be be
configured to work with them by either specifying the appropriate
programmer on the command line or by creating a new entry in its
configuration file. All that's usually required for a new entry is to
tell AVRDUDE which pins to use for each programming function.

A number of equally simple bit-bang programming adapters that connect
to a serial port are supported as well, among them the popular
Ponyprog serial adapter, and the DASA and DASA3 adapters that used to
be supported by uisp(1).  Note that these adapters are meant to be
attached to a physical serial port.  Connecting to a serial port
emulated on top of USB is likely to not work at all, or to work
abysmally slow.

The STK500, JTAG ICE, avr910, and avr109/butterfly use the serial port to communicate with the PC.
The STK600, JTAG ICE mkII, AVRISP mkII, USBasp, and USBtinyISP
programmers communicate through the USB, using @code{libusb} as a
platform abstraction layer.
The STK500, STK600, JTAG ICE, and avr910 contain on-board logic to control the programming of the target
device.
The avr109 bootloader implements a protocol similar to avr910, but is
actually implemented in the boot area of the target's flash ROM, as
opposed to being an external device.
The fundamental difference between the two types lies in the
protocol used to control the programmer. The avr910 protocol is very
simplistic and can easily be used as the basis for a simple, home made
programer since the firmware is available online. On the other hand,
the STK500 protocol is more robust and complicated and the firmware is
not openly available.
The JTAG ICE also uses a serial communication protocol which is similar
to the STK500 firmware version 2 one.  However, as the JTAG ICE is
intented to allow on-chip debugging as well as memory programming, the
protocol is more sophisticated.
(The JTAG ICE mkII protocol can also be run on top of USB.)
Only the memory programming functionality of the JTAG ICE is supported
by AVRDUDE.
For the JTAG ICE mkII, JTAG, debugWire and ISP mode are supported.
See below for the limitations of debugWire.

The AVR Dragon is supported in all modes (ISP, JTAG, HVSP, PP, debugWire).
When used in JTAG and debugWire mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to a
JTAG ICE mkII, so all device-specific comments for that device
will apply as well.
When used in ISP mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to an
AVRISP mkII (or JTAG ICE mkII in ISP mode), so all device-specific
comments will apply there.
In particular, the Dragon starts out with a rather fast ISP clock
frequency, so the @code{-B @var{bitclock}}
option might be required to achieve a stable ISP communication.

The USBasp ISP and USBtinyISP adapters are also supported, provided AVRDUDE
has been compiled with libusb support.
They both feature simple firwmare-only USB implementations, running on
an ATmega8 (or ATmega88), or ATtiny2313, respectively.

@section History and Credits

AVRDUDE was written by Brian S. Dean under the name of AVRPROG to run on
the FreeBSD Operating System.  Brian renamed the software to be called
AVRDUDE when interest grew in a Windows port of the software so that the
name did not conflict with AVRPROG.EXE which is the name of Atmel's
Windows programming software.

The AVRDUDE source now resides in the public CVS repository on
savannah.gnu.org (@url{http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/avrdude/}),
where it continues to be enhanced and ported to other systems.  In
addition to FreeBSD, AVRDUDE now runs on Linux and Windows.  The
developers behind the porting effort primarily were Ted Roth, Eric
Weddington, and Joerg Wunsch.

And in the spirit of many open source projects, this manual also draws
on the work of others.  The initial revision was composed of parts of
the original Unix manual page written by Joerg Wunsch, the original web
site documentation by Brian Dean, and from the comments describing the
fields in the AVRDUDE configuration file by Brian Dean.  The texi
formatting was modeled after that of the Simulavr documentation by Ted
Roth.

@section Option Descriptions

@noindent
AVRDUDE is a command line tool, used as follows:

@smallexample
avrdude -p partno @var{options} @dots{}
@end smallexample

@noindent
Command line options are used to control AVRDUDE's behaviour.  The
following options are recognized:

@table @code
@item -p @var{partno}
This is the only mandatory option and it tells AVRDUDE what type of part
(MCU) that is connected to the programmer.  The @var{partno} parameter
is the part's id listed in the configuration file.  Specify -p ? to list
all parts in the configuration file.  If a part is unknown
to AVRDUDE, it means that there is no config file entry for that part,
but it can be added to the configuration file if you have the Atmel
datasheet so that you can enter the programming specifications.
Currently, the following MCU types are understood:

(*)   The AT90S2323 and ATtiny22 use the same algorithm.

(**)  Flash addressing above 128 KB is not supported by all
programming hardware.  Known to work are jtag2, stk500v2,
and bit-bang programmers.

@item -b @var{baudrate}
Override the RS-232 connection baud rate specified in the respective
programmer's entry of the configuration file.

@item -B @var{bitclock}
Specify the bit clock period for the JTAG interface or the ISP clock (JTAG ICE only).
The value is a floating-point number in microseconds.
The default value of the JTAG ICE results in about 1 microsecond bit
clock period, suitable for target MCUs running at 4 MHz clock and
above.
Unlike certain parameters in the STK500, the JTAG ICE resets all its
parameters to default values when the programming software signs
off from the ICE, so for MCUs running at lower clock speeds, this
parameter must be specified on the command-line.

@item -c @var{programmer-id}
Specify the programmer to be used.  AVRDUDE knows about several common
programmers.  Use this option to specify which one to use.  The
@var{programmer-id} parameter is the programmer's id listed in the
configuration file.  Specify -c ? to list all programmers in the
configuration file.  If you have a programmer that is unknown to
AVRDUDE, and the programmer is controlled via the PC parallel port,
there's a good chance that it can be easily added to the configuration
file without any code changes to AVRDUDE.  Simply copy an existing entry
and change the pin definitions to match that of the unknown programmer.
Currently, the following programmer ids are understood and supported:

@item -C @var{config-file}
Use the specified config file for configuration data.  This file
contains all programmer and part definitions that AVRDUDE knows about.
If you have a programmer or part that AVRDUDE does not know about, you
can add it to the config file (be sure and submit a patch back to the
author so that it can be incorporated for the next version).  If not
specified, AVRDUDE reads the configuration file from
/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf (FreeBSD and Linux). See Appendix A for
the method of searching for the configuration file for Windows.

@item -D
Disable auto erase for flash.  When the -U option with flash memory is 
specified, avrdude will perform a chip erase before starting any of the 
programming operations, since it generally is a mistake to program the flash
without performing an erase first.  This option disables that.
Auto erase is not used for ATxmega devices as these devices can
use page erase before writing each page so no explicit chip erase
is required.
Note however that any page not affected by the current operation
will retain its previous contents.

@item -e
Causes a chip erase to be executed.  This will reset the contents of the
flash ROM and EEPROM to the value `0xff', and clear all lock bits.
Except for ATxmega devices which can use page erase,
it is basically a
prerequisite command before the flash ROM can be reprogrammed again.
The only exception would be if the new contents would exclusively cause
bits to be programmed from the value `1' to `0'.  Note that in order
to reprogram EERPOM cells, no explicit prior chip erase is required
since the MCU provides an auto-erase cycle in that case before
programming the cell.


@item -E @var{exitspec}[,@dots{}]
By default, AVRDUDE leaves the parallel port in the same state at exit
as it has been found at startup.  This option modifies the state of the
`/RESET' and `Vcc' lines the parallel port is left at, according to
the exitspec arguments provided, as follows:

@table @code
@itemx reset
The `/RESET' signal will be left activated at program exit, that is it
will be held low, in order to keep the MCU in reset state afterwards.
Note in particular that the programming algorithm for the AT90S1200
device mandates that the `/RESET' signal is active before powering up
the MCU, so in case an external power supply is used for this MCU type,
a previous invocation of AVRDUDE with this option specified is one of
the possible ways to guarantee this condition.

@itemx noreset
The `/RESET' line will be deactivated at program exit, thus allowing the
MCU target program to run while the programming hardware remains
connected.

@itemx vcc
This option will leave those parallel port pins active (i. e. high) that
can be used to supply `Vcc' power to the MCU.

@itemx novcc
This option will pull the `Vcc' pins of the parallel port down at
program exit.

@end table

Multiple @var{exitspec} arguments can be separated with commas.


@item -F
Normally, AVRDUDE tries to verify that the device signature read from
the part is reasonable before continuing.  Since it can happen from time
to time that a device has a broken (erased or overwritten) device
signature but is otherwise operating normally, this options is provided
to override the check.
Also, for programmers like the Atmel STK500 and STK600 which can
adjust parameters local to the programming tool (independent of an
actual connection to a target controller), this option can be used
together with @option{-t} to continue in terminal mode.

@item -i @var{delay}
For bitbang-type programmers, delay for approximately
@var{delay}
microseconds between each bit state change.
If the host system is very fast, or the target runs off a slow clock
(like a 32 kHz crystal, or the 128 kHz internal RC oscillator), this
can become necessary to satisfy the requirement that the ISP clock
frequency must not be higher than 1/4 of the CPU clock frequency.
This is implemented as a spin-loop delay to allow even for very
short delays.
On Unix-style operating systems, the spin loop is initially calibrated
against a system timer, so the number of microseconds might be rather
realistic, assuming a constant system load while AVRDUDE is running.
On Win32 operating systems, a preconfigured number of cycles per
microsecond is assumed that might be off a bit for very fast or very
slow machines.

@item -n
No-write - disables actually writing data to the MCU (useful for
debugging AVRDUDE).

@item -O
Perform a RC oscillator run-time calibration according to Atmel
application note AVR053.
This is only supported on the STK500v2, AVRISP mkII, and JTAG ICE mkII
hardware.
Note that the result will be stored in the EEPROM cell at address 0.

@item -P @var{port}
Use port to identify the device to which the programmer is attached.
Normally, the default parallel port is used, but if the programmer type
normally connects to the serial port, the default serial port will be
used. See Appendix A, Platform Dependent Information, to find out the
default port names for your platform. If you need to use a different
parallel or serial port, use this option to specify the alternate port name.

For the JTAG ICE mkII, if AVRDUDE has been built with libusb support,
@var{port} may alternatively be specified as
@code{usb}[:@var{serialno}].  In that case, the JTAG ICE mkII will be
looked up on USB.  If @var{serialno} is also specified, it will be
matched against the serial number read from any JTAG ICE mkII found on
USB.  The match is done after stripping any existing colons from the
given serial number, and right-to-left, so only the least significant
bytes from the serial number need to be given.
For a trick how to find out the serial numbers of all JTAG ICEs
attached to USB, see @ref{Example Command Line Invocations}.

As the AVRISP mkII device can only be talked to over USB, the very
same method of specifying the port is required there.

For the USB programmer "AVR-Doper" running in HID mode, the port must
be specified as @var{avrdoper}. Libusb support is required on Unix
but not on Windows. For more information about AVR-Doper see
@url{http://www.obdev.at/avrusb/avrdoper.html}.

For programmers that attach to a serial port using some kind of
higher level protocol (as opposed to bit-bang style programmers),
@var{port} can be specified as @code{net}:@var{host}:@var{port}.
In this case, instead of trying to open a local device, a TCP
network connection to (TCP) @var{port} on @var{host}
is established.
The remote endpoint is assumed to be a terminal or console server
that connects the network stream to a local serial port where the
actual programmer has been attached to.
The port is assumed to be properly configured, for example using a
transparent 8-bit data connection without parity at 115200 Baud
for a STK500.

@emph{This feature is currently not implemented for Win32 systems.}


@item -q
Disable (or quell) output of the progress bar while reading or writing
to the device.  Specify it a second time for even quieter operation.

@item -u
Disables the default behaviour of reading out the fuses three times before
programming, then verifying at the end of programming that the fuses have not
changed. If you want to change fuses you will need to specify this option,
as avrdude will see the fuses have changed (even though you wanted to) and
will change them back for your "saftey". This option was designed to
prevent cases of fuse bits magically changing (usually called @emph{safemode}).

@item -t
Tells AVRDUDE to enter the interactive ``terminal'' mode instead of up-
or downloading files.  See below for a detailed description of the
terminal mode.

@item -U @var{memtype}:@var{op}:@var{filename}[:@var{format}]
Perform a memory operation, equivalent to specifing the @option{-m},
@option{-i} or @option{-o}, and @option{-f} options, except that
multiple @option{-U} optins can be specified in order to operate on
mulitple memories on the same command-line invocation.  The
@var{memtype} field specifies the memory type to operate on. Use
the @option{-v} option on the command line or the @code{part} command from
terminal mode to display all the memory types supported by a particular
device.
Typically, a device's memory configuration at least contains
the memory types
@code{flash}
and
@code{eeprom}.
All memory types currently known are:
@table @code
@item calibration
One or more bytes of RC oscillator calibration data.
@item eeprom
The EEPROM of the device.
@item efuse
The extended fuse byte.
@item flash
The flash ROM of the device.
@item fuse
The fuse byte in devices that have only a single fuse byte.
@item hfuse
The high fuse byte.
@item lfuse
The low fuse byte.
@item lock
The lock byte.
@item signature
The three device signature bytes (device ID).
@end table

The @var{op} field specifies what operation to perform:

@table @code
@itemx r
read the specified device memory and write to the specified file

@itemx w
read the specified file and write it to the specified device memory

@itemx v
read the specified device memory and the specified file and perform a verify operation

@end table

The @var{filename} field indicates the name of the file to read or
write.  The @var{format} field is optional and contains the format of
the file to read or write.  Possible values are:

@table @code
@itemx i
Intel Hex

@itemx s
Motorola S-record

@itemx r
raw binary; little-endian byte order, in the case of the flash ROM data

@itemx m
immediate mode; actual byte values specified on the command line,
seperated by commas or spaces in place of the @var{filename} field of
the @option{-i}, @option{-o}, or @option{-U} options.  This is useful
for programming fuse bytes without having to create a single-byte file
or enter terminal mode.  If the number specified begins with @code{0x},
it is treated as a hex value.  If the number otherwise begins with a
leading zero (@code{0}) it is treated as octal.  Otherwise, the value is
treated as decimal.

@itemx a
auto detect; valid for input only, and only if the input is not provided
at stdin.

@itemx d
decimal; this and the following formats are only valid on output.
They generate one line of output for the respective memory section,
forming a comma-separated list of the values.
This can be particularly useful for subsequent processing, like for
fuse bit settings.

@itemx h
hexadecimal; each value will get the string @emph{0x} prepended.

@itemx o
octal; each value will get a @emph{0}
prepended unless it is less than 8 in which case it gets no prefix.

@itemx b
binary; each value will get the string @emph{0b} prepended.

@end table

The default is to use auto detection for input files, and raw binary
format for output files.

Note that if @var{filename} contains a colon, the @var{format} field is
no longer optional since the filename part following the colon would
otherwise be misinterpreted as @var{format}.

As an abbreviation, the form @code{-U} @var{filename}
is equivalent to specifying
@code{-U} @emph{flash:w:}@var{filename}@emph{:a}.
This will only work if @var{filename} does not have a colon in it.

@item -v
Enable verbose output.

@item -V
Disable automatic verify check when uploading data.

@item -x @var{extended_param}
Pass @var{extended_param} to the chosen programmer implementation as
an extended parameter.  The interpretation of the extended parameter
depends on the programmer itself.  See below for a list of programmers
accepting extended parameters.

@item -y
Tells AVRDUDE to use the last four bytes of the connected parts' EEPROM
memory to track the number of times the device has been erased.  When
this option is used and the @option{-e} flag is specified to generate a
chip erase, the previous counter will be saved before the chip erase, it
is then incremented, and written back after the erase cycle completes.
Presumably, the device would only be erased just before being
programmed, and thus, this can be utilized to give an indication of how
many erase-rewrite cycles the part has undergone.  Since the FLASH
memory can only endure a finite number of erase-rewrite cycles, one can
use this option to track when a part is nearing the limit.  The typical
limit for Atmel AVR FLASH is 1000 cycles.  Of course, if the
application needs the last four bytes of EEPROM memory, this option
should not be used.

@item -Y @var{cycles}
Instructs AVRDUDE to initialize the erase-rewrite cycle counter residing
at the last four bytes of EEPROM memory to the specified value.  If the
application needs the last four bytes of EEPROM memory, this option
should not be used.

@chapter Terminal Mode Operation

AVRDUDE has an interactive mode called @var{terminal mode} that is
enabled by the @option{-t} option.  This mode allows one to enter
interactive commands to display and modify the various device memories,
perform a chip erase, display the device signature bytes and part
parameters, and to send raw programming commands.  Commands and
parameters may be abbreviated to their shortest unambiguous form.
Terminal mode also supports a command history so that previously entered
commands can be recalled and edited.

@end menu

@node Terminal Mode Commands, Terminal Mode Examples, Terminal Mode Operation, Terminal Mode Operation
@section Terminal Mode Commands

@noindent
The following commands are implemented:

@table @code

@item dump @var{memtype} @var{addr} @var{nbytes}
Read @var{nbytes} from the specified memory area, and display them in
the usual hexadecimal and ASCII form.

@item dump
Continue dumping the memory contents for another @var{nbytes} where the
previous dump command left off.

@item write @var{memtype} @var{addr} @var{byte1} @dots{} @var{byteN}
Manually program the respective memory cells, starting at address addr,
using the values @var{byte1} through @var{byteN}.  This feature is not
implemented for bank-addressed memories such as the flash memory of
ATMega devices.

@item erase
Perform a chip erase.

@item send @var{b1} @var{b2} @var{b3} @var{b4}
Send raw instruction codes to the AVR device.  If you need access to a
feature of an AVR part that is not directly supported by AVRDUDE, this
command allows you to use it, even though AVRDUDE does not implement the
command.   When using direct SPI mode, up to 3 bytes
can be omitted.

@item sig
Display the device signature bytes.

@item spi
Enter direct SPI mode.  The @emph{pgmled} pin acts as slave select.
@emph{Only supported on parallel bitbang programmers.}

@item part
Display the current part settings and parameters.  Includes chip
specific information including all memory types supported by the
device, read/write timing, etc.

@item pgm
Return to programming mode (from direct SPI mode).

@item ?
@itemx help
Give a short on-line summary of the available commands.

@item quit
Leave terminal mode and thus AVRDUDE.

@end table

@noindent
In addition, the following commands are supported on the STK500
and STK600 programmer:

@table @code

@item vtarg @var{voltage}
Set the target's supply voltage to @var{voltage} Volts.

@item varef [@var{channel}] @var{voltage}
Set the adjustable voltage source to @var{voltage} Volts.
This voltage is normally used to drive the target's
@emph{Aref} input on the STK500 and STK600.
The STK600 offers two reference voltages, which can be
selected by the optional parameter @var{channel} (either
0 or 1).

@item fosc @var{freq}[@code{M}|@code{k}]
Set the master oscillator to @var{freq} Hz.
An optional trailing letter @code{M}
multiplies by 1E6, a trailing letter @code{k} by 1E3.

@item fosc off
Turn the master oscillator off.

@item sck @var{period}
@emph{STK500 and STK600 only:}
Set the SCK clock period to @var{period} microseconds.

@emph{JTAG ICE only:}
Set the JTAG ICE bit clock period to @var{period} microseconds.
Note that unlike STK500 settings, this setting will be reverted to
its default value (approximately 1 microsecond) when the programming
software signs off from the JTAG ICE.
This parameter can also be used on the JTAG ICE mkII to specify the
ISP clock period when operating the ICE in ISP mode.

@item parms
@emph{STK500 and STK600 only:}
Display the current voltage and master oscillator parameters.

@emph{JTAG ICE only:}
Display the current target supply voltage and JTAG bit clock rate/period.

@node Configuration File, Programmer Specific Information, Terminal Mode Operation, Top
@chapter Configuration File

@noindent
AVRDUDE reads a configuration file upon startup which describes all of
the parts and programmers that it knows about.  The advantage of this is
that if you have a chip that is not currently supported by AVRDUDE, you
can add it to the configuration file without waiting for a new release
of AVRDUDE.  Likewise, if you have a parallel port programmer that is
not supported by AVRDUDE, chances are good that you can copy and
existing programmer definition, and with only a few changes, make your
programmer work with AVRDUDE.

AVRDUDE first looks for a system wide configuration file in a platform
dependent location.  On Unix, this is usually
@code{/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf}, while on Windows it is usally in the
same location as the executable file.  The name of this file can be
changed using the @option{-C} command line option.  After the system wide
configuration file is parsed, AVRDUDE looks for a per-user configuration
file to augment or override the system wide defaults.  On Unix, the
per-user file is @code{.avrduderc} within the user's home directory.  On
Windows, this file is the @code{avrdude.rc} file located in the same
directory as the executable.

@subsection Instruction Format

@noindent
Instruction formats are specified as a comma seperated list of string
values containing information (bit specifiers) about each of the 32 bits
of the instruction.  Bit specifiers may be one of the following formats:

@table @code

@item 1
The bit is always set on input as well as output

@item 0
the bit is always clear on input as well as output

@item x
the bit is ignored on input and output

@item a
the bit is an address bit, the bit-number matches this bit specifier's
position within the current instruction byte

@item a@var{N}
the bit is the @var{N}th address bit, bit-number = N, i.e., @code{a12}
is address bit 12 on input, @code{a0} is address bit 0.

@item i
the bit is an input data bit

@item o
the bit is an output data bit

@end table

Each instruction must be composed of 32 bit specifiers.  The instruction
specification closely follows the instruction data provided in Atmel's
data sheets for their parts.  For example, the EEPROM read and write
instruction for an AT90S2313 AVR part could be encoded as:

@smallexample

read  = "1  0  1  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x",
        "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   o o o o  o o o o";

write = "1  1  0  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x",
        "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   i i i i  i i i i";

The @code{devicecode} parameter is the device code used by the STK500

Not all memory types will implement all instructions.

@item
AVR Fuse bits and Lock bits are implemented as a type of memory.

@item
Example memory types are: @code{flash}, @code{eeprom}, @code{fuse},
@code{lfuse} (low fuse), @code{hfuse} (high fuse), @code{efuse}
(extended fuse), @code{signature}, @code{calibration}, @code{lock}.

@item
The memory type specified on the AVRDUDE command line must match one of
the memory types defined for the specified chip.

@item
The @code{pwroff_after_write} flag causes AVRDUDE to attempt to power
the device off and back on after an unsuccessful write to the affected
memory area if VCC programmer pins are defined.  If VCC pins are not
defined for the programmer, a message indicating that the device needs a
power-cycle is printed out.  This flag was added to work around a
problem with the at90s4433/2333's; see the at90s4433 errata at:

         @url{http://www.atmel.com/atmel/acrobat/doc1280.pdf}

@item
The boot loader from application note AVR109 (and thus also the AVR
Butterfly) does not support writing of fuse bits.  Writing lock bits
is supported, but is restricted to the boot lock bits (BLBxx).  These
are restrictions imposed by the underlying SPM instruction that is used
to program the device from inside the boot loader.  Note that programming
the boot lock bits can result in a ``shoot-into-your-foot'' scenario as
the only way to unprogram these bits is a chip erase, which will also
erase the boot loader code.

The boot loader implements the ``chip erase'' function by erasing the
flash pages of the application section.

Reading fuse and lock bits is fully supported.

Note that due to the unability to write the fuse bits, the safemode
functionality does not make sense for these boot loaders.

Ensure the correct socket and routing card are mounted @emph{before}
powering on the STK600.  While the STK600 firmware ensures the socket
and routing card mounted match each other (using a table stored
internally in nonvolatile memory), it cannot handle the case where a
wrong routing card is used, e. g. the routing card
@code{STK600-RC040M-5} (which is meant for 40-pin DIP AVRs that have
an ADC, with the power supply pins in the center of the package) was
used but an ATmega8515 inserted (which uses the ``industry standard''
pinout with Vcc and GND at opposite corners).

Note that for devices that use the routing card @code{STK600-RC008T-2},
in order to use ISP mode, the jumper for @code{AREF0} must be removed
as it would otherwise block one of the ISP signals.  High-voltage
serial programming can be used even with that jumper installed.

The ISP system of the STK600 contains a detection against shortcuts
and other wiring errors.  AVRDUDE initiates a connection check before
trying to enter ISP programming mode, and display the result if the
target is not found ready to be ISP programmed.

High-voltage programming requires the target voltage to be set to at
least 4.5 V in order to work.  This can be done using
@emph{Terminal Mode}, see @ref{Terminal Mode Operation}.

On your desktop PC, lpt1 will be the most common choice. If you are
using a laptop, you might have to use lpt3 instead of lpt1. Select the
name of the port the corresponds to the base address of the parallel
port that you want.

If the parallel port can be accessed through a different
address, this address can be specified directly, using the common C
language notation (i. e., hexadecimal values are prefixed by @code{0x}).

@subsubsection Windows NT/2K/XP

@noindent
On Windows NT, 2000, and XP user applications cannot directly access the
parallel port. However, kernel mode drivers can access the parallel port.
giveio.sys is a driver that can allow user applications to set the state
of the parallel port pins.

Before using AVRDUDE, the giveio.sys driver must be loaded. The
accompanying command-line program, loaddrv.exe, can do just that.

To make things even easier there are 3 batch files that are also
included:

@enumerate
@item install_giveio.bat
Install and start the giveio driver.

@item status_giveio.bat
Check on the status of the giveio driver.

@item remove_giveio.bat
Stop and remove the giveio driver from memory.
@end enumerate

These 3 batch files calls the loaddrv program with various options to
install, start, stop, and remove the driver.

When you first execute install_giveio.bat, loaddrv.exe and giveio.sys
must be in the current directory. When install_giveio.bat is executed it
will copy giveio.sys from your current directory to your Windows
directory. It will then load the driver from the Windows directory. This
means that after the first time install_giveio is executed, you should 
be able to subsequently execute the batch file from any directory and have
it successfully start the driver.

Note that you must have administrator privilege to load the giveio driver.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Problem: I'm using a serial programmer under Windows and get the following
error:

@code{avrdude: serial_open(): can't set attributes for device "com1"},

Solution: This problem seems to appear with certain versions of Cygwin. Specifying
@code{"/dev/com1"} instead of @code{"com1"} should help.


@item
Problem: I'm using linux and my AVR910 programmer is really slow.

Solution (short): @code{setserial @var{port} low_latency}

Solution (long):
There are two problems here. First, the system may wait some time before it
passes data from the serial port to the program. Under Linux the following
command works around this (you may need root privileges for this).

@code{setserial @var{port} low_latency}

Secondly, the serial interface chip may delay the interrupt for some time.
This behaviour can be changed by setting the FIFO-threshold to one. Under Linux this
can only be done by changing the kernel source in @code{drivers/char/serial.c}.
Search the file for @code{UART_FCR_TRIGGER_8} and replace it with @code{UART_FCR_TRIGGER_1}. Note that overall performance might suffer if there
is high throughput on serial lines. Also note that you are modifying the kernel at
your own risk.


@item
Problem: I'm not using linux and my AVR910 programmer is really slow.

Solutions: The reasons for this are the same as above.
If you know how to work around this on your OS, please let us know.

@item
Problem: Updating the flash ROM from terminal mode does not work with the
JTAG ICEs.

Solution: None at this time.  Currently, the JTAG ICE code cannot
write to the flash ROM one byte at a time.

@item
Problem: Page-mode programming the EEPROM (using the -U option) does
not erase EEPROM cells before writing, and thus cannot overwrite any
previous value != 0xff.

Solution: None.  This is an inherent feature of the way JTAG EEPROM
programming works, and is documented that way in the Atmel AVR
datasheets.
In order to successfully program the EEPROM that way, a prior chip
erase (with the EESAVE fuse unprogrammed) is required.
This also applies to the STK500 and STK600 in high-voltage programming mode.

@item
Problem: How do I turn off the @var{DWEN} fuse?

Solution: If the @var{DWEN} (debugWire enable) fuse is activated,
the @var{/RESET} pin is not functional anymore, so normal ISP
communication cannot be established.
There are two options to deactivate that fuse again: high-voltage
programming, or getting the JTAG ICE mkII talk debugWire, and
prepare the target AVR to accept normal ISP communication again.

The first option requires a programmer that is capable of high-voltage
programming (either serial or parallel, depending on the AVR device),
for example the STK500.  In high-voltage programming mode, the
@var{/RESET} pin is activated initially using a 12 V pulse (thus the
name @emph{high voltage}), so the target AVR can subsequently be
reprogrammed, and the @var{DWEN} fuse can be cleared.  Typically, this
operation cannot be performed while the AVR is located in the target
circuit though.

The second option requires a JTAG ICE mkII that can talk the debugWire
protocol.  The ICE needs to be connected to the target using the
JTAG-to-ISP adapter, so the JTAG ICE mkII can be used as a debugWire
initiator as well as an ISP programmer.  AVRDUDE will then be activated
using the @var{jtag2isp} programmer type.  The initial ISP
communication attempt will fail, but AVRDUDE then tries to iniate a
debugWire reset.  When successful, this will leave the target AVR in a
state where it can accept standard ISP communication.  The ICE is then
signed off (which will make it signing off from the USB as well), so
AVRDUDE has to be called again afterwards.  This time, standard ISP
communication can work, so the @var{DWEN} fuse can be cleared.

The pin mapping for the JTAG-to-ISP adapter is:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2
@item @strong{JTAG pin} @tab @strong{ISP pin}
@item 1 @tab 3
@item 2 @tab 6
@item 3 @tab 1
@item 4 @tab 2
@item 6 @tab 5
@item 9 @tab 4
@end multitable

Problem: Multiple USBasp or USBtinyISP programmers connected simultaneously are not
found.

Solution: none at this time.  The simplicity of these programmers
doesn't offer a method to distinguish multiple programmers that are
connected simultaneously, so effectively only one of them is supported.

@item
Problem: I cannot do @dots{} when the target is in debugWire mode.

Solution: debugWire mode imposes several limitations.

The debugWire protocol is Atmel's proprietary one-wire (plus ground)
protocol to allow an in-circuit emulation of the smaller AVR devices,
using the @var{/RESET} line.
DebugWire mode is initiated by activating the @var{DWEN}
fuse, and then power-cycling the target.
While this mode is mainly intented for debugging/emulation, it
also offers limited programming capabilities.
Effectively, the only memory areas that can be read or programmed
in this mode are flash ROM and EEPROM.
It is also possible to read out the signature.
All other memory areas cannot be accessed.
There is no
@emph{chip erase}
functionality in debugWire mode; instead, while reprogramming the
flash ROM, each flash ROM page is erased right before updating it.
This is done transparently by the JTAG ICE mkII (or AVR Dragon).
The only way back from debugWire mode is to initiate a special
sequence of commands to the JTAG ICE mkII (or AVR Dragon), so the
debugWire mode will be temporarily disabled, and the target can
be accessed using normal ISP programming.
This sequence is automatically initiated by using the JTAG ICE mkII
or AVR Dragon in ISP mode, when they detect that ISP mode cannot be
entered.
