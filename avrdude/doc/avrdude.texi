@cindex introduction

AVRDUDE - AVR Downloader Uploader - is a program for downloading and
uploading the on-chip memories of Atmel's AVR microcontrollers. It can
program the Flash and EEPROM, and where supported by the serial
programming protocol, it can program fuse and lock bits. AVRDUDE also
supplies a direct instruction mode allowing one to issue any programming
instruction to the AVR chip regardless of whether AVRDUDE implements
that specific feature of a particular chip.

AVRDUDE can be used effectively via the command line to read or write
all chip memory types (eeprom, flash, fuse bits, lock bits, signature
bytes) or via an interactive (terminal) mode. Using AVRDUDE from the
command line works well for programming the entire memory of the chip
from the contents of a file, while interactive mode is useful for
exploring memory contents, modifing individual bytes of eeprom,
programming fuse/lock bits, etc.

AVRDUDE supports three basic programmer types: Atmel's STK500, appnote
avr910 and the PPI (parallel port interface). PPI represents a class
of simple programmers where the programming lines are directly
connected to the PC parallel port. Several pin configurations exist
for several variations of the PPI programmers, and AVRDUDE can be be
configured to work with them by either specifying the appropriate
programmer on the command line or by creating a new entry in its
configuration file. All that's usually required for a new entry is to
tell AVRDUDE which pins to use for each programming function. 

The STK500 and avr910 use the serial port to communicate with the PC
and contains on-board logic to control the programming of the target
device. The fundamental difference between the two types lies in the
protocol used to control the programmer. The avr910 protocol is very
simplistic and can easily be used as the basis for a simple, home made
programer since the firmware is available online. On the other hand,
the STK500 protocol is more robust and complicated and the firmware is
not openly available.

@section History and Credits

AVRDUDE was written by Brian S. Dean under the name of AVRPROG to run on
the FreeBSD Operating System.  Brian renamed the software to be called
AVRDUDE when interest grew in a Windows port of the software so that the
name did not conflict with AVRPROG.EXE which is the name of Atmel's
Windows programming software.

The AVRDUDE source now resides in the public CVS repository on
savannah.gnu.org (@url{http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/avrdude/}),
where it continues to be enhanced and ported to other systems.  In
addition to FreeBSD, AVRDUDE now runs on Linux and Windows.  The
developers behind the porting effort primarily were Ted Roth, Eric
Weddington, and Joerg Wunsch.

And in the spirit of many open source projects, this manual also draws
on the work of others.  The initial revision was composed of parts of
the original Unix manual page written by Joerg Wunsch, the original web
site documentation by Brian Dean, and from the comments describing the
fields in the AVRDUDE configuration file by Brian Dean.  The texi
formatting was modeled after that of the Simulavr documentation by Ted
Roth.

@section Option Descriptions

@noindent
AVRDUDE is a command line tool, used as follows:

@example
avrdude -p partno @var{options} @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
Command line options are used to control AVRDUDE's behaviour.  The
following options are recognized:

@table @code
@item -p @var{partno}
This is the only mandatory option and it tells AVRDUDE what type of part
(MCU) that is connected to the programmer.  The @var{partno} parameter
is the part's id listed in the configuration file.  Specify -p ? to list 
all parts in the configuration file.  If a part is unknown
to AVRDUDE, it means that there is no config file entry for that part,
but it can be added to the configuration file if you have the Atmel
datasheet so that you can enter the programming specifications.
Currently, the following MCU types are understood:

@table @code
@itemx 1200
AT90S1200

@itemx 2313

@end table

(*)   The AT90S2323 uses the same algorithm.

@item -c @var{programmer-id}
Specify the programmer to be used.  AVRDUDE knows about several common
programmers.  Use this option to specify which one to use.  The
@var{programmer-id} parameter is the programmer's id listed in the
configuration file.  Specify -c ? to list all programmers in the
configuration file.  If you have a programmer that is unknown to
AVRDUDE, and the programmer is controlled via the PC parallel port,
there's a good chance that it can be easily added to the configuration
file without any code changes to AVRDUDE.  Simply copy an existing entry
and change the pin definitions to match that of the unknown programmer.
Currently, the following programmer ids are understood and supported:

@end table



@item -C @var{config-file}
Use the specified config file for configuration data.  This file
contains all programmer and part definitions that AVRDUDE knows about.
If you have a programmer or part that AVRDUDE does not know about, you
can add it to the config file (be sure and submit a patch back to the
author so that it can be incorporated for the next version).  If not
specified, AVRDUDE reads the configuration file from
/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf (FreeBSD and Linux). See Appendix A for
the method of searching for the configuration file for Windows.

@item -D
Disable auto erase for flash.  When the -U option with flash memory is 
specified, avrdude will perform a chip erase before starting any of the 
programming operations, since it generally is a mistake to program the flash
without performing an erase first.  This option disables that.  However, to 
remain backward compatible, the -i, and -m options automatically disable the 
auto erase feature.

@item -e
Causes a chip erase to be executed.  This will reset the contents of the
flash ROM and EEPROM to the value `0xff', and is basically a
prerequisite command before the flash ROM can be reprogrammed again.
The only exception would be if the new contents would exclusively cause
bits to be programmed from the value `1' to `0'.  Note that in order
to reprogram EERPOM cells, no explicit prior chip erase is required
since the MCU provides an auto-erase cycle in that case before
programming the cell.


@item -E @var{exitspec}[,@dots{}]
By default, AVRDUDE leaves the parallel port in the same state at exit
as it has been found at startup.  This option modifies the state of the
`/RESET' and `Vcc' lines the parallel port is left at, according to
the exitspec arguments provided, as follows:

@table @code
@itemx reset
The `/RESET' signal will be left activated at program exit, that is it
will be held low, in order to keep the MCU in reset state afterwards.
Note in particular that the programming algorithm for the AT90S1200
device mandates that the `/RESET' signal is active before powering up
the MCU, so in case an external power supply is used for this MCU type,
a previous invocation of AVRDUDE with this option specified is one of
the possible ways to guarantee this condition.

@itemx noreset
The `/RESET' line will be deactivated at program exit, thus allowing the
MCU target program to run while the programming hardware remains
connected.

@itemx vcc 
This option will leave those parallel port pins active (i. e. high) that
can be used to supply `Vcc' power to the MCU.

@itemx novcc
This option will pull the `Vcc' pins of the parallel port down at
program exit.

@end table

Multiple @var{exitspec} arguments can be separated with commas.



@item -f @var{format}
This option specifies the file format for the input or output files to
be processed.  Format can be one of:

@table @code
@itemx i
Intel Hex

@itemx s
Motorola S-record

@itemx r
raw binary; little-endian byte order, in the case of the flash ROM data

@itemx m
immediate mode; actual byte values specified on the command line,
seperated by commas or spaces in place of the @var{filename} field of
the @option{-i}, @option{-o}, or @option{-U} options.  This is useful
for programming fuse bytes without having to create a single-byte file
or enter terminal mode.  If the number specified begins with @code{0x},
it is treated as a hex value.  If the number otherwise begins with a
leading zero (@code{0}) it is treated as octal.  Otherwise, the value is
treated as decimal.

@itemx a
auto detect; valid for input only, and only if the input is not provided
at stdin.

@end table

The default is to use auto detection for input files, and raw binary
format for output files.

@item -F
Normally, AVRDUDE tries to verify that the device signature read from
the part is reasonable before continuing.  Since it can happen from time
to time that a device has a broken (erased or overwritten) device
signature but is otherwise operating normally, this options is provided
to override the check.

@item -i @var{filename}
Specifies the input file to be programmed into the MCU.  Can be
specified as `-' to use stdin as the input.

@item -m @var{memtype}
Specifies which program area of the MCU to read or write; allowable
values depend on the MCU being programmed, but most support at least
@code{eeprom} for the EEPROM, and @code{flash} for the flash ROM.  Use
the @option{-v} option on the command line or the @code{part} command from
terminal mode to display all the memory types supported by a particular
device.  The default is @code{flash}.

@item -n
No-write - disables actually writing data to the MCU (useful for
debugging AVRDUDE).

@item -o @var{filename}
Specifies the name of the output file to write, and causes the
respective memory area to be read from the MCU.  Can be specified as `-'
to write to stdout.

@item -P @var{port}
Use port to identify the device to which the programmer is attached.  
Normally, the default parallel port is used, but if the programmer type 
normally connects to the serial port, the default serial port will be
used. See Appendix A, Platform Dependent Information, to find out the 
default port names for your platform. If you need to use a different 
parallel or serial port, use this option to specify the alternate port name.

@item -q
Disable (or quell) output of the progress bar while reading or writing
to the device.

@item -t
Tells AVRDUDE to enter the interactive ``terminal'' mode instead of up-
or downloading files.  See below for a detailed description of the
terminal mode.

@item -U @var{memtype}:@var{op}:@var{filename}[:@var{format}]
Perform a memory operation, equivalent to specifing the @option{-m},
@option{-i} or @option{-o}, and @option{-f} options, except that
multiple @option{-U} optins can be specified in order to operate on
mulitple memories on the same command-line invocation.  The
@var{memtype} field specifies the memory type to operate on.  The
@var{op} field specifies what operation to perform:

@table @code
@itemx r
read the specified device memory and write to the specified file

@itemx w
read the specified file and write it to the specified device memory

@itemx v
read the specified device memory and the specified file and perform a verify operation

@end table

The @var{filename} field indicates the name of the file to read or
write.  The @var{format} field is optional and contains the format of
the file to read or write.  See the @option{-f} option for possible
values.
Note that if @var{filename} contains a colon, the @var{format} field is
no longer optional since the filename part following the colon would
otherwise be misinterpreted as @var{format}.

@item -v
Enable verbose output.

@item -V
Disable automatic verify check when uploading data.

@item -y
Tells AVRDUDE to use the last four bytes of the connected parts' EEPROM
memory to track the number of times the device has been erased.  When
this option is used and the @option{-e} flag is specified to generate a
chip erase, the previous counter will be saved before the chip erase, it
is then incremented, and written back after the erase cycle completes.
Presumably, the device would only be erased just before being
programmed, and thus, this can be utilized to give an indication of how
many erase-rewrite cycles the part has undergone.  Since the FLASH
memory can only endure a finite number of erase-rewrite cycles, one can
use this option to track when a part is nearing the limit.  The typical
limit for Atmel AVR FLASH is 1000 cycles.  Of course, if the
application needs the last four bytes of EEPROM memory, this option
should not be used.

@item -Y @var{cycles}
Instructs AVRDUDE to initialize the erase-rewrite cycle counter residing
at the last four bytes of EEPROM memory to the specified value.  If the
application needs the last four bytes of EEPROM memory, this option
should not be used.

@chapter Terminal Mode Operation

AVRDUDE has an interactive mode called @var{terminal mode} that is
enabled by the @option{-t} option.  This mode allows one to enter
interactive commands to display and modify the various device memories,
perform a chip erase, display the device signature bytes and part
parameters, and to send raw programming commands.  Commands and
parameters may be abbreviated to their shortest unambiguous form.
Terminal mode also supports a command history so that previously entered
commands can be recalled and edited.

@item dump @var{memtype} @var{addr} @var{nbytes}
Read @var{nbytes} from the specified memory area, and display them in
the usual hexadecimal and ASCII form.

@item dump
Continue dumping the memory contents for another @var{nbytes} where the
previous dump command left off.

@item write @var{memtype} @var{addr} @var{byte1} @dots{} @var{byteN}
Manually program the respective memory cells, starting at address addr,
using the values @var{byte1} through @var{byteN}.  This feature is not
implemented for bank-addressed memories such as the flash memory of
ATMega devices.

@item erase
Perform a chip erase.

@item send @var{b1} @var{b2} @var{b3} @var{b4}
Send raw instruction codes to the AVR device.  If you need access to a
feature of an AVR part that is not directly supported by AVRDUDE, this
command allows you to use it, even though AVRDUDE does not implement the
command.

@chapter Configuration File

@noindent
AVRDUDE reads a configuration file upon startup which describes all of
the parts and programmers that it knows about.  The advantage of this is
that if you have a chip that is not currently supported by AVRDUDE, you
can add it to the configuration file without waiting for a new release
of AVRDUDE.  Likewise, if you have a parallel port programmer that is
not supported by AVRDUDE, chances are good that you can copy and
existing programmer definition, and with only a few changes, make your
programmer work with AVRDUDE.

AVRDUDE first looks for a system wide configuration file in a platform
dependent location.  On Unix, this is usually
@code{/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf}, while on Windows it is usally in the
same location as the executable file.  The name of this file can be
changed using the @option{-C} command line option.  After the system wide
configuration file is parsed, AVRDUDE looks for a per-user configuration
file to augment or override the system wide defaults.  On Unix, the
per-user file is @code{.avrduderc} within the user's home directory.  On
Windows, this file is the @code{avrdude.rc} file located in the same
directory as the executable.

@subsection Instruction Format

@noindent
Instruction formats are specified as a comma seperated list of string
values containing information (bit specifiers) about each of the 32 bits
of the instruction.  Bit specifiers may be one of the following formats:

@table @code

@item 1
The bit is always set on input as well as output

@item 0
the bit is always clear on input as well as output

@item x
the bit is ignored on input and output

@item a
the bit is an address bit, the bit-number matches this bit specifier's
position within the current instruction byte

@item a@var{N}
the bit is the @var{N}th address bit, bit-number = N, i.e., @code{a12}
is address bit 12 on input, @code{a0} is address bit 0.

@item i
the bit is an input data bit

@item o
the bit is an output data bit

@end table

Each instruction must be composed of 32 bit specifiers.  The instruction
specification closely follows the instruction data provided in Atmel's
data sheets for their parts.  For example, the EEPROM read and write
instruction for an AT90S2313 AVR part could be encoded as:

@example

read  = "1  0  1  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x", 
        "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   o o o o  o o o o";

write = "1  1  0  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x",
        "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   i i i i  i i i i";

The @code{devicecode} parameter is the device code used by the STK500
and is obtained from the software section (@code{avr061.zip}) of

@item
Not all memory types will implement all instructions.

@item
AVR Fuse bits and Lock bits are implemented as a type of memory.

@item
Example memory types are: @code{flash}, @code{eeprom}, @code{fuse},
@code{lfuse} (low fuse), @code{hfuse} (high fuse), @code{efuse}
(extended fuse), @code{signature}, @code{calibration}, @code{lock}.

@item
The memory type specified on the AVRDUDE command line must match one of
the memory types defined for the specified chip.

@item
The @code{pwroff_after_write} flag causes AVRDUDE to attempt to power
the device off and back on after an unsuccessful write to the affected
memory area if VCC programmer pins are defined.  If VCC pins are not
defined for the programmer, a message indicating that the device needs a
power-cycle is printed out.  This flag was added to work around a
problem with the at90s4433/2333's; see the at90s4433 errata at:

environment variable.

If you do not have root access to your system, you can do the the
following instead:

@subsubsection Windows NT/2K/XP

@noindent
On Windows NT, 2000, and XP user applications cannot directly access the
parallel port. However, kernel mode drivers can access the parallel port.
giveio.sys is a driver that can allow user applications to set the state
of the parallel port pins.

Before using AVRDUDE, the giveio.sys driver must be loaded. The
accompanying command-line program, loaddrv.exe, can do just that.

To make things even easier there are 3 batch files that are also
included:

@enumerate
@item install_giveio.bat
Install and start the giveio driver.

@item status_giveio.bat
Check on the status of the giveio driver.

@item remove_giveio.bat
Stop and remove the giveio driver from memory.
@end enumerate

These 3 batch files calls the loaddrv program with various options to
install, start, stop, and remove the driver.

When you first execute install_giveio.bat, loaddrv.exe and giveio.sys
must be in the current directory. When install_giveio.bat is executed it
will copy giveio.sys from your current directory to your Windows
directory. It will then load the driver from the Windows directory. This
means that after the first time install_giveio is executed, you should 
be able to subsequently execute the batch file from any directory and have
it successfully start the driver.

Note that you must have administrator privilege to load the giveio driver.
