  * Keep track of input file contents

      Memory segments are being tracked to remember whether they've
      been actually read from a file.  Only segments that came from a
      file are being programmed into the device, or considered for
      verification.  This drastically improves handling speed for
      sparse files (e.g. files that have a second bootloader segment),
      and it ensures the device contents is actually compared for
      everything mentioned in the file (even in case the file has
      large 0xFF blocks).

  * The eraes cycle counter (formerly options -y / -Y) has been
    removed.

  * The -U option now accepts ELF files as input files, and extracts
    the appropriate section contents that matches the requested memory
    region.

  * Specifying a -U option without a memory type (short form of
    option argument list) now defaults to "application" memory for
    Xmega devices, and "flash" for everything else.  This ensures
    the bootloader is not touched.

  * For programmers that support it, the default erase method is a
    page erase now, rather than a chip erase (Xmega only).

  * Programmers and parts lists

    They are now sorted at output with '-c ?'/'-p ?'. (patch #7671:
    Sorting programmers and parts lists for console output)

    Programmers and parts lists in documentation generated from lists
    mentioned above. (patch #7687: Autogenerating programmers and
    parts lists for docs)

    Output list of programmer types with '-c ?type', add list to
    documentation

  * Configuration files now accepts parent parts/programmers, parts
    starting with '.' (eg. .xmega) are not included in output parts
    list and can be used as abstract parents

    (bug #34302: Feature request : device configuration with parent classes)
    (patch #7688: Implement parent programmers feature)

  * Additional config files which are read after default can be
    specified on command line using '-C +filename'

    (patch #7699 Read additional config files)

  * The new option -l logfile allows to redirect diagnostic messages
    to a logfile rather than stdout.  Useful to record debugging
    traces, in particular in environments which do not offer
    shell-style redirection functionality for standard streams.

  * When leaving debugWIRE mode, immediately retry with ISP rather
    than bailing out completely.

  * Programmer types in configuration file are no longer keywords but
    specified as string.

    So you need to change 'type = XYZ;' to 'type = "XYZ";' in own
    config files.  (internal: The parser does not need to know all
    programmer types now, new programmers will update only the table
    in pgm_type.c.)

  * The USBasp programmer implementation now supports detailed traces
    with -vvv, and device communication traces with -vvvv.

  * Internals:

    - Restructuring and compacting programmer definition part of
      grammar for config file.
    - Cleanup of parser code, removing unused definitions/
      functions. Using yylex_destroy if available.
    - Fixed some more memory leaks, added cleanup code at program exit
      (to minimize the number of non-freed memory blocks reported by
      valgrind)
    - Fixed some findings reported by cppcheck.

Version 5.11:

  * New devices supported:
      - ATmega88P/168P
      - ATmega8U2/16U2/32U2
      - ATtiny4313

  * New programmers supported:
      - TPI programming through bitbang programmers (both, serial

    reasons.

  * Various fixes for avr910 and butterfly programmers

  * Full support for AVR109 boot loaders (butterfly)

  * Adding -q -q suppresses most terminal output


Version 4.4.0:

    anymore. Additionally, the delay timing on windows should be
    more accurate now.
    Contributed by Martin Thomas

  * Add support for
    - ATmega48, ATmega88 (contributed by Galen Seitz)
    - ATtiny2313 (contributed by Bob Paddock)
    - ATtiny13 (contributed by Pawel Moll)

  * Added command to change the SCK of STK500-programmers. Now it
    is possible to program uC with slow oscillator.
    Contributed by Galen Seitz

  * Baudrate for serial programmers (STK500 and AVR910) is
    configurable in the config or at the command-line.
    This way some more tweaked bootloaders and programmers can be used.

  * Deprecated options have been removed.
    Now the "-U" option must be used.

  * MacOS X now supported by default.

Version 4.3.0:

  * Added support for "Butterfly" evaluation board.

  * Make cycle-count work with AVR910-programmers.

  * Added "Troubleshooting"-Appendix to the manual.

  * Add ATmega8515 support.
    Contributed by: Matthias Weiﬂer <matthias@matwei.de>

  * Add ATmega64 support.
    Contributed by: Erik Christiansen <erik@dd.nec.com.au>

  * Improved polling algorithm to speed up
    programming of byte oriented parallel programmers.
    Contributed by: Jan-Hinnerk Reichert <jan-hinnerk_reichert@hamburg.de>

  * Add "fuse" and "lock" definitions for the AT90S8535.

  * STK500 skips empty pages in paged write resulting in faster downloads
    when there are empty blocks in between code (such as files that contain
    application code and bootloader code).

Version 4.2.0:

  * Add basic support for reading and writing fuses via SPI with avr910
    programmers. Submitted by
    Jan-Hinnerk Reichert <jan-hinnerk_reichert@hamburg.de>.

  * Perform an auto erase before programming if the flash memory is
    anywhere specified to be written by any of the -U requests.  Old
    style memory specification options (-f, -i, -I, -m, and -o) are
    deprecated in favor of the new -U options.  Auto erase is disabled
    if any of the old-style options (specifically -i and -o) are
    specified.

  * Add new -U option for specifying programming operations - allows
    multiple memory operations on a single command line.

  * New progress reporting, looks nicer and is nicer to wrapper
    environments such as emacs.

  * Fix long-standing timing (verify) problems on Windows platform.
    Submitted by Alex Shepherd <ashepherd@wave.co.nz>.

  * Add new file format option - 'm' for "immediate mode."  In this
    case, the filename argument of the -o, -i, or -U options is
    treated as the data for uploading - useful for specifying fuse
    bits without having to create a single-byte file for uploading.

  * Add support for displaying and setting the various STK500 operational
    parameters (Vtarget, Varef, Master clock).

  * Add 'picoweb' programming cable programmer.
    Contributed by Rune Christensen <rune.christensen@adslhome.dk>.

  * Add support for the sp12 programmer.  Submitted by
    Larry Barello <larryba@barrello.net>.


Version 4.1.0

  * Add support for the Bascom SAMPLE programmer. Submitted by
    Larry Barello <larryba@barrello.net>.

  * Add support for avr910 type programmers (mcu00100, pavr avr910, etc).

  * Support new devices: ATmega8535, ATtiny26
  

Version 4.0.0

  * Now support Linux - added by "Theodore A. Roth" <troth@openavr.org>.

  * Now support Windows - added by "Eric B. Weddington" <eric@ecentral.com>.

  * Use 'configure' scripts to tailor the code to the system avrdude
    is getting ready to be compiled on - added by "Theodore A. Roth"
    <troth@openavr.org>.

  * Motorola S-Record support - submitted by "Alexey V.Levdikov "
    <tsar@kemford.com>.

  * Support parallel programming on the STK500.  Introduce 'pagel' and
    'bs2' keywords to the config file for this purpose.

  * Add support for the AT90S2343

  * Add support for the ATmega169

  * Add ability to specify system defaults within the config file
    (default parallel port, default serial port).

  * Specify the default programmer seperately from the programmer
    definition.  This is now done in the config file using the
    'default_programmer' keyword.

  * Support a per-user config file (~/.avrduderc) so that one can
    override system wide defaults if desired.

  * Follow the datasheet more closely for several parts in the "retry"
    code when entering programming mode fails initially.  Introduce
    'retry_pulse' to the config file for this purpose.



Version 3.1.0

  * This change represents a name change only.  There is currently an
    effort to port AVRPROG to other platforms including Linux and
    Windows.  Since Atmel's programmer binary that's included within
    their AVR Studio software is named AVRPROG.EXE on the Windows OS,
    there is the chance for confusion if we keep calling this program
    AVRPROG as well.  Up until now the name hasn't really been a
    problem since there was no chance to confuse 'avrprog' on Unix
    with Atmel's AVRPROG because Atmel's tools only run on Windows.
    But with the Unix 'avrprog' possibly being ported to Windows, I
    felt a name change was the best way to avoid problems.

    So - from this point forward, my FreeBSD Unix program formerly
    known as AVRPROG will subsequently be known as AVRDUDE (AVR
    Downloader/UploaDEr).

    This change also represents a time when the AVRDUDE sources move
    from my own private repository to a public repository.  This will
    give other developers a chance to port AVRDUDE to other platforms
    and extend its functionality to support additional programming
    hardware, etc.

    So goodbye AVRPROG, welcome AVRDUDE!

Version 3.0.0

  * Rewrite parts of the code to make it easy to support other types
    of programmers besides the directly connected parallel port
    programmer (PPI).

  * Add support for Atmel's STK500 programmer/development board.  The
    STK500's "paged mode" read/write is supported which makes this
    programmer very fast.  This is sorely needed on parts with large
    memories such as the ATmega128.  My 12K test program burns in
    about 5 seconds, add another 5 to read it back out for
    verification.


Version 2.1.5:

  * When getting ready to initiate communications with the AVR device,
    first pull /RESET low for a short period of time before enabling
    the buffer chip.  This sequence allows the AVR to be reset before
    the buffer is enabled to avoid a short period of time where the
    AVR may be driving the programming lines at the same time the
    programmer tries to.  Of course, if a buffer is being used, then
    the /RESET line from the programmer needs to be directly connected
    to the AVR /RESET line and not via the buffer chip.

    Feature contributed by Rick C. Petty <rick@KIWI-Computer.com>.

  * When in interactive terminal mode and dumping memory using the
    'dump <memtype>' command without any address information, and the
    end of memory is reached, wrap back around to zero on the next
    invocation.


Version 2.1.4:

  * Fix -Y option.


Version 2.1.3:

  * Be backward compatible when reading 2-byte rewrite cycle counters
    as written by avrprog version 2.1.0.  Version 2.1.1 changed over
    to a 4-byte counter, which caused avrprog versions 2.1.1 and 2.1.2
    to report a negative count for parts that were initialized using
    version 2.1.0.  Thanks to Joerg Wunsch for noticing this.


Version 2.1.2:

  * Add '-V' option to disable automatic verify check with uploading
    data.


Version 2.1.1:

  * Fix ATmega128 instruction sequences for reading fuse bits -
    contributed by Joerg Wunsch.

  * Modify erase-rewrite cycle counter code to use a 4 byte counter
    instead of a two byte counter.


Version 2.1.0:

  * Implement a per-part erase-rewrite cycle counter; requires the use
    of two bytes of EEPROM memory.


Version 2.0.5:

  * Support for ATtiny15 - contributed by Asher Hoskins


Version 2.0.4:

  * Config file fixes for various parts.


Version 2.0.3:

  * Work around problem programming fuse bits on parts like the
    at90s4433 as described in the following errata:

      http://www.atmel.com/atmel/acrobat/doc1280.pdf

  * Add part definition for at90s4414, at90s4433.

  * Add fuse/lock bit memory instructions for the at90s1200,
    at90s2333, at90s4433 and at90s8515.

  * Fix setting of programmer status LEDs under certain write-fail
    conditions.


Version 2.0.2 :

  * Fix writing to read-only memories such as the lock bits of the
    AT90S2313.

  * Copyright updates.


Version 2.0.1 :

  * Use correct parallel port pins for VCC.

  * Add programmer definition for Atmel's STK200.

  * Add programmer definition for the AVR3 board.

  * Fix address bit encoding for many parts.

  * Allow the ``BUFF'' signal to be asserted by multiple pins of the
    parallel port (like VCC) instead of just one.  The STK200 appears
    to need this feature.


Version 2.0.0 :

  * Add support for programming fuse and lock bits if supported by the
    part.

  * Move instruction encoding into the config file.  Now any part can
    be supported as long as it uses the same basic serial programming
    instruction format.

  * Add part definitions for the ATMega163 and ATMega8 devices.


Version 1.4.3 :

  * Mostly internal code cleanup.


Version 1.4.2 :

  * Fixes for ATMega paged memory support.

  * Support for ATMega16 device.


Version 1.4.1 :

  * No functional changes, update to Copyrights only.
