Approximate change log for AVRPROG by version

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.5:

  * When getting ready to initiate communications with the AVR device,
    first pull /RESET low for a short period of time before enabling
    the buffer chip.  This sequence allows the AVR to be reset before
    the buffer is enabled to avoid a short period of time where the
    AVR may be driving the programming lines at the same time the
    programmer tries to.  Of course, if a buffer is being used, then
    the /RESET line from the programmer needs to be directly connected
    to the AVR /RESET line and not via the buffer chip.

    Feature contributed by Rick C. Petty <rick@KIWI-Computer.com>.

  * When in interactive terminal mode and dumping memory using the
    'dump <memtype>' command without any address information, and the
    end of memory is reached, wrap back around to zero on the next
    invocation.


Version 2.1.4:

  * Fix -Y option.


Version 2.1.3:

  * Be backward compatible when reading 2-byte rewrite cycle counters
    as written by avrprog version 2.1.0.  Version 2.1.1 changed over
    to a 4-byte counter, which caused avrprog versions 2.1.1 and 2.1.2
    to report a negative count for parts that were initialized using
    version 2.1.0.  Thanks to Joerg Wunsch for noticing this.


Version 2.1.2:

  * Add '-V' option to disable automatic verify check with uploading
    data.


Version 2.1.1:

  * Fix ATmega128 instruction sequences for reading fuse bits -
    contributed by Joerg Wunsch.

  * Modify erase-rewrite cycle counter code to use a 4 byte counter
    instead of a two byte counter.


Version 2.1.0:

  * Implement a per-part erase-rewrite cycle counter; requires the use
    of two bytes of EEPROM memory.


Version 2.0.5:

  * Support for ATtiny15 - contributed by Asher Hoskins


Version 2.0.4:

  * Config file fixes for various parts.


Version 2.0.3:

  * Work around problem programming fuse bits on parts like the
    at90s4433 as described in the following errata:

      http://www.atmel.com/atmel/acrobat/doc1280.pdf

  * Add part definition for at90s4414, at90s4433.

  * Add fuse/lock bit memory instructions for the at90s1200,
    at90s2333, at90s4433 and at90s8515.

  * Fix setting of programmer status LEDs under certain write-fail
    conditions.


Version 2.0.2 :

  * Fix writing to read-only memories such as the lock bits of the
    AT90S2313.

  * Copyright updates.


Version 2.0.1 :

  * Use correct parallel port pins for VCC.

  * Add programmer definition for Atmel's STK200.

  * Add programmer definition for the AVR3 board.

  * Fix address bit encoding for many parts.

  * Allow the ``BUFF'' signal to be asserted by multiple pins of the
    parallel port (like VCC) instead of just one.  The STK200 appears
    to need this feature.


Version 2.0.0 :

  * Add support for programming fuse and lock bits if supported by the
    part.

  * Move instruction encoding into the config file.  Now any part can
    be supported as long as it uses the same basic serial programming
    instruction format.

  * Add part definitions for the ATMega163 and ATMega8 devices.


Version 1.4.3 :

  * Mostly internal code cleanup.


Version 1.4.2 :

  * Fixes for ATMega paged memory support.

  * Support for ATMega16 device.


Version 1.4.1 :

  * No functional changes, update to Copyrights only.


Version 1.4.0 :

  * Add part definitions to the config file.

  * Add initial support for Atmel's ATMega paged memory parts.

  * Config file documentation added.

  * Add a definition for the Dontronics DT006 programmer.

  * Fix Intel Hex support for addresses larger than 64k.


Version 1.3.0 :

  * Make programmer pin assignments configurable.


Version 1.2.2 :

  * Initial public release
