@cindex Introduction

AVRDUDE - AVR Downloader Uploader - is a program for downloading and
uploading the on-chip memories of Atmel's AVR microcontrollers. It can
program the Flash and EEPROM, and where supported by the serial
programming protocol, it can program fuse and lock bits. AVRDUDE also
supplies a direct instruction mode allowing one to issue any programming
instruction to the AVR chip regardless of whether AVRDUDE implements
that specific feature of a particular chip.

AVRDUDE can be used effectively via the command line to read or write
all chip memory types (eeprom, flash, fuse bits, lock bits, signature
bytes) or via an interactive (terminal) mode. Using AVRDUDE from the
command line works well for programming the entire memory of the chip
from the contents of a file, while interactive mode is useful for
exploring memory contents, modifying individual bytes of eeprom,
programming fuse/lock bits, etc.

@cindex Programmers supported

AVRDUDE supports the following basic programmer types: Atmel's STK500,
Atmel's AVRISP and AVRISP mkII devices,
Atmel's STK600,
Atmel's JTAG ICE (the original one, mkII, and 3, the latter two also in ISP mode), appnote
avr910, appnote avr109 (including the AVR Butterfly),
serial bit-bang adapters,
and the PPI (parallel port interface). PPI represents a class
of simple programmers where the programming lines are directly
connected to the PC parallel port. Several pin configurations exist
for several variations of the PPI programmers, and AVRDUDE can be
configured to work with them by either specifying the appropriate
programmer on the command line or by creating a new entry in its
configuration file. All that's usually required for a new entry is to
tell AVRDUDE which pins to use for each programming function.

A number of equally simple bit-bang programming adapters that connect
to a serial port are supported as well, among them the popular
Ponyprog serial adapter, and the DASA and DASA3 adapters that used to
be supported by uisp(1).  Note that these adapters are meant to be
attached to a physical serial port.  Connecting to a serial port
emulated on top of USB is likely to not work at all, or to work
abysmally slow.

If you happen to have a Linux system with at least 4 hardware GPIOs 
available (like almost all embedded Linux boards) you can do without 
any additional hardware - just connect them to the MOSI, MISO, RESET 
and SCK pins on the AVR and use the linuxgpio programmer type. It bitbangs
the lines using the Linux sysfs GPIO interface. Of course, care should
be taken about voltage level compatibility. Also, although not strictly 
required, it is strongly advisable to protect the GPIO pins from 
overcurrent situations in some way. The simplest would be to just put
some resistors in series or better yet use a 3-state buffer driver like
the 74HC244. Have a look at http://kolev.info/blog/2013/01/06/avrdude-linuxgpio/ for a more
detailed tutorial about using this programmer type.

Under a Linux installation with direct access to the SPI bus and GPIO
pins, such as would be found on a Raspberry Pi, the ``linuxspi''
programmer type can be used to directly connect to and program a chip
using the built in interfaces on the computer. The requirements to use
this type are that an SPI interface is exposed along with one GPIO
pin. The GPIO serves as the reset output since the Linux SPI drivers
do not hold slave select down when a transfer is not occuring and thus
it cannot be used as the reset pin. A readily available level
translator should be used between the SPI bus/reset GPIO and the chip
to avoid potentially damaging the computer's SPI controller in the
event that the chip is running at 5V and the SPI runs at 3.3V. The
GPIO chosen for reset can be configured in the avrdude configuration
file using the @code{reset} entry under the linuxspi programmer, or
directly in the port specification. An external pull-up resistor
should be connected between the AVR's reset pin and Vcc. If Vcc is not
the same as the SPI voltage, this should be done on the AVR side of
the level translator to protect the hardware from damage.

On a Raspberry Pi, header J8 provides access to the SPI and GPIO
lines.

Typically, pins 19, 21, and 23 are SPI MOSI, MISO, and SCK, while
pins 24 and 26 would serve as CE outputs. So, close to these pins
is pin 22 as GPIO25 which can be used as /RESET, and pin 25 can
be used as GND.

A typical programming cable would then look like:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15 .3
@item @code{J8 pin} @tab @code{ISP pin} @tab @code{Name}
@item @code{21}     @tab @code{1}   @tab @code{MISO}
@item @code{-}      @tab @code{2}   @tab @code{Vcc - leave open}
@item @code{23}     @tab @code{3}   @tab @code{SCK}
@item @code{19}     @tab @code{4}   @tab @code{MOSI}
@item @code{22}     @tab @code{5}   @tab @code{/RESET}
@item @code{25}     @tab @code{6}   @tab @code{GND}
@end multitable

(Mind the 3.3 V voltage level of the Raspberry Pi!)

The @code{-P @var{portname}} option defaults to
@code{/dev/spidev0.0:/dev/gpiochip0} for this programmer.

The STK500, JTAG ICE, avr910, and avr109/butterfly use the serial port to communicate with the PC.
The STK600, JTAG ICE mkII/3, AVRISP mkII, USBasp, avrftdi (and derivatives), and USBtinyISP
programmers communicate through the USB, using @code{libusb} as a
platform abstraction layer.
The avrftdi adds support for the FT2232C/D, FT2232H, and FT4232H devices. These all use 
the MPSSE mode, which has a specific pin mapping. Bit 1 (the lsb of the byte in the config
file) is SCK. Bit 2 is MOSI, and Bit 3 is MISO. Bit 4 usually reset. The 2232C/D parts
are only supported on interface A, but the H parts can be either A or B (specified by the
usbdev config parameter).
The STK500, STK600, JTAG ICE, and avr910 contain on-board logic to control the programming of the target
device.
The avr109 bootloader implements a protocol similar to avr910, but is
actually implemented in the boot area of the target's flash ROM, as
opposed to being an external device.
The fundamental difference between the two types lies in the
protocol used to control the programmer. The avr910 protocol is very
simplistic and can easily be used as the basis for a simple, home made
programmer since the firmware is available online. On the other hand,
the STK500 protocol is more robust and complicated and the firmware is
not openly available.
The JTAG ICE also uses a serial communication protocol which is similar
to the STK500 firmware version 2 one.  However, as the JTAG ICE is
intended to allow on-chip debugging as well as memory programming, the
protocol is more sophisticated.
(The JTAG ICE mkII protocol can also be run on top of USB.)
Only the memory programming functionality of the JTAG ICE is supported
by AVRDUDE.
For the JTAG ICE mkII/3, JTAG, debugWire and ISP mode are supported, provided
it has a firmware revision of at least 4.14 (decimal).
See below for the limitations of debugWire.
For ATxmega devices, the JTAG ICE mkII/3 is supported in PDI mode, provided it
has a revision 1 hardware and firmware version of at least 5.37 (decimal).

The Atmel-ICE (ARM/AVR) is supported (JTAG, PDI for Xmega, debugWIRE, ISP modes).

Atmel's XplainedPro boards, using EDBG protocol (CMSIS-DAP compliant), are
supported by the ``jtag3'' programmer type.

Atmel's XplainedMini boards, using mEDBG protocol, are also
supported by the ``jtag3'' programmer type.

The AVR Dragon is supported in all modes (ISP, JTAG, PDI, HVSP, PP, debugWire).
When used in JTAG and debugWire mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to a
JTAG ICE mkII, so all device-specific comments for that device
will apply as well.
When used in ISP and PDI mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to an
AVRISP mkII (or JTAG ICE mkII in ISP mode), so all device-specific
comments will apply there.
In particular, the Dragon starts out with a rather fast ISP clock
frequency, so the @code{-B @var{bitclock}}
option might be required to achieve a stable ISP communication.
For ATxmega devices, the AVR Dragon is supported in PDI mode, provided it
has a firmware version of at least 6.11 (decimal).

Wiring boards (e.g. Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3) are supported, utilizing
STK500 V2.x protocol, but a simple DTR/RTS toggle to set the boards
into programming mode.  The programmer type is ``wiring''. Note that
the -D option will likely be required in this case, because the
bootloader will rewrite the program memory, but no true chip erase can
be performed.

The Arduino (which is very similar to the STK500 1.x) is supported via
its own programmer type specification ``arduino''.  This programmer works for
the Arduino Uno Rev3 or any AVR that runs the Optiboot bootloader.
The number of connection retry attempts can be specified as an
extended parameter. See the section on
@emph{extended parameters}
below for details.

The BusPirate is a versatile tool that can also be used as an AVR programmer.
A single BusPirate can be connected to up to 3 independent AVRs. See
the section on
@emph{extended parameters}
below for details.

The USBasp ISP and USBtinyISP adapters are also supported, provided AVRDUDE
has been compiled with libusb support.
They both feature simple firmware-only USB implementations, running on
an ATmega8 (or ATmega88), or ATtiny2313, respectively.

The Atmel DFU bootloader is supported in both, FLIP protocol version 1
(AT90USB* and ATmega*U* devices), as well as version 2 (Xmega devices).
See below for some hints about FLIP version 1 protocol behaviour.

The MPLAB(R) PICkit 4 and MPLAB(R) SNAP are supported in ISP, PDI and UPDI mode.
The Curiosity Nano board is supported in UPDI mode. It is dubbed ``PICkit on
Board'', thus the name @code{pkobn_updi}.

SerialUPDI programmer implementation is based on Microchip's 
@emph{pymcuprog} (@url{https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-tools/pymcuprog}) 
utility, but it also contains some performance improvements included in
Spence Konde's @emph{DxCore} Arduino core (@url{https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore}).
In a nutshell, this programmer consists of simple USB->UART adapter, diode 
and couple of resistors. It uses serial connection to provide UPDI interface. 
@xref{SerialUPDI programmer} for more details and known issues.

The jtag2updi programmer is supported,
and can program AVRs with a UPDI interface.
Jtag2updi is just a firmware that can be uploaded to an AVR,
which enables it to interface with avrdude using the jtagice mkii protocol
via a serial link (@url{https://github.com/ElTangas/jtag2updi}).

The Micronucleus bootloader is supported for both protocol version V1
and V2. As the bootloader does not support reading from flash memory,
use the @code{-V} option to prevent AVRDUDE from verifing the flash memory.
See the section on @emph{extended parameters}
below for Micronucleus specific options.

The Teensy bootloader is supported for all AVR boards.
As the bootloader does not support reading from flash memory,
use the @code{-V} option to prevent AVRDUDE from verifing the flash memory.
See the section on @emph{extended parameters}
below for Teensy specific options.

@section History and Credits

AVRDUDE was written by Brian S. Dean under the name of AVRPROG to run on
the FreeBSD Operating System.  Brian renamed the software to be called
AVRDUDE when interest grew in a Windows port of the software so that the
name did not conflict with AVRPROG.EXE which is the name of Atmel's
Windows programming software.

For many years, the AVRDUDE source resided in public repositories on
savannah.nongnu.org,
where it continued to be enhanced and ported to other systems.  In
addition to FreeBSD, AVRDUDE now runs on Linux and Windows.  The
developers behind the porting effort primarily were Ted Roth, Eric
Weddington, and Joerg Wunsch.

In 2022, the project moved to Github (@url{https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude/}).

And in the spirit of many open source projects, this manual also draws
on the work of others.  The initial revision was composed of parts of
the original Unix manual page written by Joerg Wunsch, the original web
site documentation by Brian Dean, and from the comments describing the
fields in the AVRDUDE configuration file by Brian Dean.  The texi
formatting was modeled after that of the Simulavr documentation by Ted
Roth.

@section Option Descriptions

@noindent
AVRDUDE is a command line tool, used as follows:

@smallexample
avrdude -p partno @var{options} @dots{}
@end smallexample

@noindent
Command line options are used to control AVRDUDE's behaviour.  The
following options are recognized:

@table @code
@item -p @var{partno}
This is the only mandatory option and it tells AVRDUDE what type of part
(MCU) that is connected to the programmer.  The @var{partno} parameter
is the part's id listed in the configuration file.  Specify -p ? to list
all parts in the configuration file.  If a part is unknown
to AVRDUDE, it means that there is no config file entry for that part,
but it can be added to the configuration file if you have the Atmel
datasheet so that you can enter the programming specifications.
Currently, the following MCU types are understood:

@cindex Device support

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .3
@include parts.texi
@end multitable

(*)   The AT90S2323 and ATtiny22 use the same algorithm.

(**)  Flash addressing above 128 KB is not supported by all
programming hardware.  Known to work are jtag2, stk500v2,
and bit-bang programmers.

(***)
The ATtiny11 can only be
programmed in high-voltage serial mode.

(****)
The ISP programming protocol of the AT90S1200 differs in subtle ways
from that of other AVRs.  Thus, not all programmers support this
device.  Known to work are all direct bitbang programmers, and all
programmers talking the STK500v2 protocol.

@item -b @var{baudrate}
Override the RS-232 connection baud rate specified in the respective
programmer's entry of the configuration file.

@item -B @var{bitclock}
Specify the bit clock period for the JTAG interface or the ISP clock (JTAG ICE only).
The value is a floating-point number in microseconds.
Alternatively, the value might be suffixed with "Hz", "kHz", or "MHz",
in order to specify the bit clock frequency, rather than a period.
The default value of the JTAG ICE results in about 1 microsecond bit
clock period, suitable for target MCUs running at 4 MHz clock and
above.
Unlike certain parameters in the STK500, the JTAG ICE resets all its
parameters to default values when the programming software signs
off from the ICE, so for MCUs running at lower clock speeds, this
parameter must be specified on the command-line.
It can also be set in the configuration file by using the 'default_bitclock'
keyword.

@item -c @var{programmer-id}
Specify the programmer to be used.  AVRDUDE knows about several common
programmers.  Use this option to specify which one to use.  The
@var{programmer-id} parameter is the programmer's id listed in the
configuration file.  Specify -c ? to list all programmers in the
configuration file.  If you have a programmer that is unknown to
AVRDUDE, and the programmer is controlled via the PC parallel port,
there's a good chance that it can be easily added to the configuration
file without any code changes to AVRDUDE.  Simply copy an existing entry
and change the pin definitions to match that of the unknown programmer.
Currently, the following programmer ids are understood and supported:

@cindex Programmer support

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .6
@include programmers.texi
@end multitable



@item -C @var{config-file}
Use the specified config file for configuration data.  This file
contains all programmer and part definitions that AVRDUDE knows about.
If not specified, AVRDUDE looks for the configuration file in the following
two locations:

@enumerate

@item
@code{<directory from which application loaded>/../etc/avrdude.conf}

@item
@code{<directory from which application loaded>/avrdude.conf}

@end enumerate

If not found there, the lookup procedure becomes platform dependent. On FreeBSD
and Linux, AVRDUDE looks at @code{/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf}. See Appendix A
for the method of searching on Windows.

If @var{config-file} is written as @var{+filename}
then this file is read after the system wide and user configuration 
files. This can be used to add entries to the configuration
without patching your system wide configuration file. It can be used 
several times, the files are read in same order as given on the command 
line.


@item -D
Disable auto erase for flash.  When the -U option with flash memory is 
specified, avrdude will perform a chip erase before starting any of the 
programming operations, since it generally is a mistake to program the flash
without performing an erase first.  This option disables that.
Auto erase is not used for ATxmega devices as these devices can
use page erase before writing each page so no explicit chip erase
is required.
Note however that any page not affected by the current operation
will retain its previous contents.

@item -e
Causes a chip erase to be executed.  This will reset the contents of the
flash ROM and EEPROM to the value `0xff', and clear all lock bits.
Except for ATxmega devices which can use page erase,
it is basically a
prerequisite command before the flash ROM can be reprogrammed again.
The only exception would be if the new contents would exclusively cause
bits to be programmed from the value `1' to `0'.  Note that in order
to reprogram EERPOM cells, no explicit prior chip erase is required
since the MCU provides an auto-erase cycle in that case before
programming the cell.


@item -E @var{exitspec}[,@dots{}]
By default, AVRDUDE leaves the parallel port in the same state at exit
as it has been found at startup.  This option modifies the state of the
`/RESET' and `Vcc' lines the parallel port is left at, according to
the exitspec arguments provided, as follows:

@table @code
@item reset
The `/RESET' signal will be left activated at program exit, that is it
will be held low, in order to keep the MCU in reset state afterwards.
Note in particular that the programming algorithm for the AT90S1200
device mandates that the `/RESET' signal is active before powering up
the MCU, so in case an external power supply is used for this MCU type,
a previous invocation of AVRDUDE with this option specified is one of
the possible ways to guarantee this condition.

@item noreset
The `/RESET' line will be deactivated at program exit, thus allowing the
MCU target program to run while the programming hardware remains
connected.

@item vcc
This option will leave those parallel port pins active (i. e. high) that
can be used to supply `Vcc' power to the MCU.

@item novcc
This option will pull the `Vcc' pins of the parallel port down at
program exit.

@item d_high
This option will leave the 8 data pins on the parallel port active
(i. e. high).

@item d_low
This option will leave the 8 data pins on the parallel port inactive
(i. e. low).

@end table

Multiple @var{exitspec} arguments can be separated with commas.


@item -F
Normally, AVRDUDE tries to verify that the device signature read from
the part is reasonable before continuing.  Since it can happen from time
to time that a device has a broken (erased or overwritten) device
signature but is otherwise operating normally, this options is provided
to override the check.
Also, for programmers like the Atmel STK500 and STK600 which can
adjust parameters local to the programming tool (independent of an
actual connection to a target controller), this option can be used
together with @option{-t} to continue in terminal mode.

@item -i @var{delay}
For bitbang-type programmers, delay for approximately
@var{delay}
microseconds between each bit state change.
If the host system is very fast, or the target runs off a slow clock
(like a 32 kHz crystal, or the 128 kHz internal RC oscillator), this
can become necessary to satisfy the requirement that the ISP clock
frequency must not be higher than 1/4 of the CPU clock frequency.
This is implemented as a spin-loop delay to allow even for very
short delays.
On Unix-style operating systems, the spin loop is initially calibrated
against a system timer, so the number of microseconds might be rather
realistic, assuming a constant system load while AVRDUDE is running.
On Win32 operating systems, a preconfigured number of cycles per
microsecond is assumed that might be off a bit for very fast or very
slow machines.

@item -l @var{logfile}
Use @var{logfile} rather than @var{stderr} for diagnostics output.
Note that initial diagnostic messages (during option parsing) are still
written to @var{stderr} anyway.

@item -n
No-write - disables actually writing data to the MCU (useful for
debugging AVRDUDE).

@item -O
Perform a RC oscillator run-time calibration according to Atmel
application note AVR053.
This is only supported on the STK500v2, AVRISP mkII, and JTAG ICE mkII
hardware.
Note that the result will be stored in the EEPROM cell at address 0.

@item -P @var{port}
Use port to identify the device to which the programmer is attached.
Normally, the default parallel port is used, but if the programmer type
normally connects to the serial port, the default serial port will be
used. See Appendix A, Platform Dependent Information, to find out the
default port names for your platform. If you need to use a different
parallel or serial port, use this option to specify the alternate port name.

On Win32 operating systems, the parallel ports are referred to as lpt1
through lpt3, referring to the addresses 0x378, 0x278, and 0x3BC,
respectively.  If the parallel port can be accessed through a different
address, this address can be specified directly, using the common C
language notation (i. e., hexadecimal values are prefixed by @var{0x}).

For the JTAG ICE mkII, if AVRDUDE has been built with libusb support,
@var{port} may alternatively be specified as
@code{usb}[:@var{serialno}].  In that case, the JTAG ICE mkII will be
looked up on USB.  If @var{serialno} is also specified, it will be
matched against the serial number read from any JTAG ICE mkII found on
USB.  The match is done after stripping any existing colons from the
given serial number, and right-to-left, so only the least significant
bytes from the serial number need to be given.
For a trick how to find out the serial numbers of all JTAG ICEs
attached to USB, see @ref{Example Command Line Invocations}.

As the AVRISP mkII device can only be talked to over USB, the very
same method of specifying the port is required there.

For the USB programmer "AVR-Doper" running in HID mode, the port must
be specified as @var{avrdoper}. Libhidapi support is required on Unix
and Mac OS but not on Windows. For more information about AVR-Doper see
@url{http://www.obdev.at/avrusb/avrdoper.html}.

For the USBtinyISP, which is a simplistic device not implementing
serial numbers, multiple devices can be distinguished by their
location in the USB hierarchy.
See the respective
@xref{Troubleshooting} entry for examples.

For the XBee programmer the target MCU is to be programmed wirelessly
over a ZigBee mesh using the XBeeBoot bootloader.  The ZigBee 64-bit
address for the target MCU's own XBee device must be supplied as a
16-character hexadecimal value as a port prefix, followed by the
@code{@@} character, and the serial device to connect to a second
directly contactable XBee device associated with the same mesh (with
a default baud rate of 9600).  This may look similar to:
@code{0013a20000000001@/dev/tty.serial}.

For diagnostic purposes, if the target MCU with an XBeeBoot
bootloader is connected directly to the serial port, the
64-bit address field can be omitted.  In this mode the
default baud rate will be 19200.

For programmers that attach to a serial port using some kind of
higher level protocol (as opposed to bit-bang style programmers),
@var{port} can be specified as @code{net}:@var{host}:@var{port}.
In this case, instead of trying to open a local device, a TCP
network connection to (TCP) @var{port} on @var{host}
is established.
Square brackets may be placed around @var{host} to improve
readability for numeric IPv6 addresses (e.g.
@code{net:[2001:db8::42]:1337}).
The remote endpoint is assumed to be a terminal or console server
that connects the network stream to a local serial port where the
actual programmer has been attached to.
The port is assumed to be properly configured, for example using a
transparent 8-bit data connection without parity at 115200 Baud
for a STK500.

Note: The ability to handle IPv6 hostnames and addresses is limited to
Posix systems (by now).

@item -q
Disable (or quell) output of the progress bar while reading or writing
to the device.  Specify it a second time for even quieter operation.

@item -t
Tells AVRDUDE to enter the interactive ``terminal'' mode instead of up-
or downloading files.  See below for a detailed description of the
terminal mode.

@item -U @var{memtype}:@var{op}:@var{filename}[:@var{format}]
Perform a memory operation.
Multiple @option{-U} options can be specified in order to operate on
multiple memories on the same command-line invocation.  The
@var{memtype} field specifies the memory type to operate on. Use
the @option{-v} option on the command line or the @code{part} command from
terminal mode to display all the memory types supported by a particular
device.
Typically, a device's memory configuration at least contains
the memory types
@code{flash}
and
@code{eeprom}.
All memory types currently known are:
@table @code
@item calibration
One or more bytes of RC oscillator calibration data.
@item eeprom
The EEPROM of the device.
@item efuse
The extended fuse byte.
@item flash
The flash ROM of the device.
@item fuse
The fuse byte in devices that have only a single fuse byte.
@item hfuse
The high fuse byte.
@item lfuse
The low fuse byte.
@item lock
The lock byte.
@item signature
The three device signature bytes (device ID).
@item fuse@emph{N}
The fuse bytes of ATxmega devices, @emph{N} is an integer number
for each fuse supported by the device.
@item application
The application flash area of ATxmega devices.
@item apptable
The application table flash area of ATxmega devices.
@item boot
The boot flash area of ATxmega devices.
@item prodsig
The production signature (calibration) area of ATxmega devices.
@item usersig
The user signature area of ATxmega devices.
@end table

The @var{op} field specifies what operation to perform:

@table @code
@item r
read the specified device memory and write to the specified file

@item w
read the specified file and write it to the specified device memory

@item v
read the specified device memory and the specified file and perform a verify operation

@end table

The @var{filename} field indicates the name of the file to read or
write.  The @var{format} field is optional and contains the format of
the file to read or write.  Possible values are:

@table @code
@item i
Intel Hex

@item s
Motorola S-record

@item r
raw binary; little-endian byte order, in the case of the flash ROM data

@item e
ELF (Executable and Linkable Format), the final output file from the
linker; currently only accepted as an input file

@item m
immediate mode; actual byte values specified on the command line,
separated by commas or spaces in place of the @var{filename} field of
the @option{-U} option.  This is useful
for programming fuse bytes without having to create a single-byte file
or enter terminal mode.  If the number specified begins with @code{0x},
it is treated as a hex value.  If the number otherwise begins with a
leading zero (@code{0}) it is treated as octal.  Otherwise, the value is
treated as decimal.

@item a
auto detect; valid for input only, and only if the input is not provided
at stdin.

@item d
decimal; this and the following formats are only valid on output.
They generate one line of output for the respective memory section,
forming a comma-separated list of the values.
This can be particularly useful for subsequent processing, like for
fuse bit settings.

@item h
hexadecimal; each value will get the string @emph{0x} prepended.

@item o
octal; each value will get a @emph{0}
prepended unless it is less than 8 in which case it gets no prefix.

@item b
binary; each value will get the string @emph{0b} prepended.

@end table

The default is to use auto detection for input files, and raw binary
format for output files.

Note that if @var{filename} contains a colon, the @var{format} field is
no longer optional since the filename part following the colon would
otherwise be misinterpreted as @var{format}.

When reading any kind of flash memory area (including the various sub-areas
in Xmega devices), the resulting output file will be truncated to not contain
trailing 0xFF bytes which indicate unprogrammed (erased) memory.
Thus, if the entire memory is unprogrammed, this will result in an output
file that has no contents at all.

As an abbreviation, the form @code{-U} @var{filename}
is equivalent to specifying
@code{-U} @emph{flash:w:}@var{filename}@emph{:a}.
This will only work if @var{filename} does not have a colon in it.

@item -v
Enable verbose output.
More @code{-v} options increase verbosity level.

@item -V
Disable automatic verify check when uploading data.

@item -x @var{extended_param}
Pass @var{extended_param} to the chosen programmer implementation as
an extended parameter.  The interpretation of the extended parameter
depends on the programmer itself.  See below for a list of programmers
accepting extended parameters.

@itemx AVR Dragon

When using the JTAG ICE mkII/3 or AVR Dragon in JTAG mode, the
following extended parameter is accepted:
@table @code
@item @samp{jtagchain=UB,UA,BB,BA}
Setup the JTAG scan chain for @var{UB} units before, @var{UA} units
after, @var{BB} bits before, and @var{BA} bits after the target AVR,
respectively.
Each AVR unit within the chain shifts by 4 bits.
Other JTAG units might require a different bit shift count.
@end table

@cindex @code{-x} AVR910
@item AVR910

The AVR910 programmer type accepts the following extended parameter:
@table @code
@item @samp{devcode=VALUE}
Override the device code selection by using @var{VALUE}
as the device code.
The programmer is not queried for the list of supported
device codes, and the specified @var{VALUE}
is not verified but used directly within the
@code{T} command sent to the programmer.
@var{VALUE} can be specified using the conventional number notation of the
C programming language.
@item @samp{no_blockmode}
Disables the default checking for block transfer capability.
Use 
@samp{no_blockmode} only if your @samp{AVR910} 
programmer creates errors during initial sequence.
@end table

@cindex @code{-x} Arduino
@item Arduino

The Arduino programmer type accepts the following extended parameter:
@table @code
@item @samp{attemps=VALUE}
Overide the default number of connection retry attempt by using @var{VALUE}.
@end table

@cindex @code{-x} Buspirate
@item BusPirate

The BusPirate programmer type accepts the following extended parameters:
@table @code
@item @samp{reset=cs,aux,aux2}
The default setup assumes the BusPirate's CS output pin connected to
the RESET pin on AVR side. It is however possible to have multiple AVRs
connected to the same BP with MISO, MOSI and SCK lines common for all of them.
In such a case one AVR should have its RESET connected to BusPirate's
@emph{CS}
pin, second AVR's RESET connected to BusPirate's
@emph{AUX}
pin and if your BusPirate has an
@emph{AUX2}
pin (only available on BusPirate version v1a with firmware 3.0 or newer)
use that to activate RESET on the third AVR.

It may be a good idea to decouple the BusPirate and the AVR's SPI buses from
each other using a 3-state bus buffer. For example 74HC125 or 74HC244 are some
good candidates with the latches driven by the appropriate reset pin (cs,
aux or aux2). Otherwise the SPI traffic in one active circuit may interfere
with programming the AVR in the other design.

@item @samp{spifreq=@var{0..7}}
@multitable @columnfractions .05 .3
@item @code{0} @tab  30 kHz (default)
@item @code{1} @tab 125 kHz
@item @code{2} @tab 250 kHz
@item @code{3} @tab   1 MHz
@item @code{4} @tab   2 MHz
@item @code{5} @tab   2.6 MHz
@item @code{6} @tab   4 MHz
@item @code{7} @tab   8 MHz
@end multitable

@item @samp{rawfreq=0..3}
Sets the SPI speed and uses the Bus Pirate's binary ``raw-wire'' mode instead
of the default binary SPI mode:

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .3
@item @code{0} @tab 5 kHz
@item @code{1} @tab 50 kHz
@item @code{2} @tab 100 kHz (Firmware v4.2+ only)
@item @code{3} @tab 400 kHz (v4.2+)
@end multitable

The only advantage of the ``raw-wire'' mode is that different SPI frequencies
are available. Paged writing is not implemented in this mode.

@item @samp{ascii}
Attempt to use ASCII mode even when the firmware supports BinMode (binary
mode).
BinMode is supported in firmware 2.7 and newer, older FW's either don't
have BinMode or their BinMode is buggy. ASCII mode is slower and makes
the above
@samp{reset=}, @samp{spifreq=}
and
@samp{rawfreq=}
parameters unavailable. Be aware that ASCII mode is not guaranteed to work
with newer firmware versions, and is retained only to maintain compatibility
with older firmware versions.

@item @samp{nopagedwrite}
Firmware versions 5.10 and newer support a binary mode SPI command that enables
whole pages to be written to AVR flash memory at once, resulting in a
significant write speed increase. If use of this mode is not desirable for some
reason, this option disables it.

@item @samp{nopagedread}
Newer firmware versions support in binary mode SPI command some AVR Extended 
Commands. Using the ``Bulk Memory Read from Flash'' results in a
significant read speed increase. If use of this mode is not desirable for some
reason, this option disables it.

@item @samp{cpufreq=@var{125..4000}}
This sets the @emph{AUX}  pin to output a frequency of @var{n} kHz. Connecting
the @emph{AUX} pin to the XTAL1 pin of your MCU, you can provide it a clock, 
for example when it needs an external clock because of wrong fuses settings.
Make sure the CPU frequency is at least four times the SPI frequency.  

@item @samp{serial_recv_timeout=@var{1...}}
This sets the serial receive timeout to the given value. 
The timeout happens every time avrdude waits for the BusPirate prompt. 
Especially in ascii mode this happens very often, so setting a smaller value 
can speed up programming a lot. 
The default value is 100ms. Using 10ms might work in most cases.  

@end table

@cindex @code{-x} Micronucleus bootloader
@item Micronucleus bootloader

When using the Micronucleus programmer type, the
following optional extended parameter is accepted:
@table @code
@item @samp{wait=@var{timeout}}
If the device is not connected, wait for the device to be plugged in.
The optional @var{timeout} specifies the connection time-out in seconds.
If no time-out is specified, AVRDUDE will wait indefinitely until the
device is plugged in.

Extended parameters:
@table @code
@item @samp{xbeeresetpin=@var{1..7}}
Select the XBee pin @code{DIO<1..7>} that is connected to the MCU's
‘/RESET’ line.  The programmer needs to know which DIO pin to use to
reset into the bootloader.  The default (3) is the @code{DIO3} pin
(XBee pin 17), but some commercial products use a different XBee
pin.

The remaining two necessary XBee-to-MCU connections are not selectable
- the XBee @code{DOUT} pin (pin 2) must be connected to the MCU's
‘RXD’ line, and the XBee @code{DIN} pin (pin 3) must be connected to
the MCU's ‘TXD’ line.

@chapter Terminal Mode Operation

AVRDUDE has an interactive mode called @var{terminal mode} that is
enabled by the @option{-t} option.  This mode allows one to enter
interactive commands to display and modify the various device memories,
perform a chip erase, display the device signature bytes and part
parameters, and to send raw programming commands.  Commands and
parameters may be abbreviated to their shortest unambiguous form.
Terminal mode also supports a command history so that previously entered
commands can be recalled and edited.

@section Terminal Mode Commands

@noindent
The following commands are implemented:

@table @code

@item dump @var{memtype} [@var{start_addr} [@var{nbytes}]]
Read @var{nbytes} from the specified memory area, and display them in
the usual hexadecimal and ASCII form.

@item dump @var{memtype} [@var{start_addr}] @dots{}
Start reading from @var{start_addr}, all the way to the last memory address.

@item dump @var{memtype}
Continue dumping the memory contents for another @var{nbytes} where the
previous dump command left off.

@item write @var{memtype} @var{start_addr} @var{data1} @var{data2} @dots{} @var{dataN}
Manually program the respective memory cells, starting at address @var{start_addr},
using the values @var{data1} through @var{dataN}.  This feature is not
implemented for bank-addressed memories such as the flash memory of
ATMega devices.

Items @var{dataN} can have the following formats:

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .4 .3
@item @strong{Type}
@tab @strong{Example}
@tab @strong{Size (bytes)}

@item Character
@tab @code{'A'}
@tab 1

@item Decimal integer
@tab 12345
@tab 1, 2, 4, or 8 (see below)

@item Octal integer
@tab 012345
@tab 1, 2, 4, or 8 (see below)

@item Hexadecimal integer
@tab 0x12345
@tab 1, 2, 4, or 8 (see below)

@item Float
@tab 3.1415926
@tab 4

@end multitable

Integer constants can be 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes long.
By default, the smallest possible size will be used where
the specified number just fits into.
A specific size can be denoted by appending one of these suffixes:

@table @code
@item LL
@itemx ll
8 bytes / 64 bits
@item L
@itemx l
4 bytes / 32 bits
@item H
@itemx h
@itemx S
@itemx s
2 bytes / 16 bits
@item HH
@itemx hh
1 byte / 8 bits
@end table

Similarly, floating-point constants can have an @code{F} or @code{f}
appended, but only 32-bit floating-point values are supported.

@item write @var{memtype} @var{start_addr} @var{length} @var{data1} @var{data2} @var{dataN} @dots{}

Similar to the above, but @var{length} byte of the memory are written.
For that purpose, after writing the initial items, @var{dataN} is
replicated as many times as needed.

@item erase
Perform a chip erase.

@item send @var{b1} @var{b2} @var{b3} @var{b4}
Send raw instruction codes to the AVR device.  If you need access to a
feature of an AVR part that is not directly supported by AVRDUDE, this
command allows you to use it, even though AVRDUDE does not implement the
command.   When using direct SPI mode, up to 3 bytes
can be omitted.

@item sig
Display the device signature bytes.

@item spi
Enter direct SPI mode.  The @emph{pgmled} pin acts as slave select.
@emph{Only supported on parallel bitbang programmers, and partially by USBtiny.}
Slave Select must be externally held low for direct SPI when
using USBtinyISP, and send must be a multiple of four bytes.

@item part
Display the current part settings and parameters.  Includes chip
specific information including all memory types supported by the
device, read/write timing, etc.

@item pgm
Return to programming mode (from direct SPI mode).

@item verbose [@var{level}]
Change (when @var{level} is provided), or display the verbosity
level.
The initial verbosity level is controlled by the number of @code{-v} options
given on the command line.

@item ?
@itemx help
Give a short on-line summary of the available commands.

@item quit
Leave terminal mode and thus AVRDUDE.

@end table

@noindent
In addition, the following commands are supported on the STK500
and STK600 programmer:

@table @code

@item vtarg @var{voltage}
Set the target's supply voltage to @var{voltage} Volts.

@item varef [@var{channel}] @var{voltage}
Set the adjustable voltage source to @var{voltage} Volts.
This voltage is normally used to drive the target's
@emph{Aref} input on the STK500 and STK600.
The STK600 offers two reference voltages, which can be
selected by the optional parameter @var{channel} (either
0 or 1).

@item fosc @var{freq}[@code{M}|@code{k}]
Set the master oscillator to @var{freq} Hz.
An optional trailing letter @code{M}
multiplies by 1E6, a trailing letter @code{k} by 1E3.

@item fosc off
Turn the master oscillator off.

@item sck @var{period}
@emph{STK500 and STK600 only:}
Set the SCK clock period to @var{period} microseconds.

@emph{JTAG ICE only:}
Set the JTAG ICE bit clock period to @var{period} microseconds.
Note that unlike STK500 settings, this setting will be reverted to
its default value (approximately 1 microsecond) when the programming
software signs off from the JTAG ICE.
This parameter can also be used on the JTAG ICE mkII/3 to specify the
ISP clock period when operating the ICE in ISP mode.

@item parms
@emph{STK500 and STK600 only:}
Display the current voltage and master oscillator parameters.

@emph{JTAG ICE only:}
Display the current target supply voltage and JTAG bit clock rate/period.

Program the fuse bits of an ATmega128 (disable M103 compatibility,
enable high speed external crystal, enable brown-out detection, slowly
rising power).  Note since we are working with fuse bits the -u (unsafe)
option is specified, which allows you to modify the fuse bits. First 
display the factory defaults, then reprogram:

@chapter Configuration File

@noindent
AVRDUDE reads a configuration file upon startup which describes all of
the parts and programmers that it knows about.  The advantage of this is
that if you have a chip that is not currently supported by AVRDUDE, you
can add it to the configuration file without waiting for a new release
of AVRDUDE.  Likewise, if you have a parallel port programmer that is
not supported by AVRDUDE, chances are good that you can copy and
existing programmer definition, and with only a few changes, make your
programmer work with AVRDUDE.

AVRDUDE first looks for a system wide configuration file in a platform
dependent location.  On Unix, this is usually
@code{/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf}, while on Windows it is usually in the
same location as the executable file.  The name of this file can be
changed using the @option{-C} command line option.  After the system wide
configuration file is parsed, AVRDUDE looks for a per-user configuration
file to augment or override the system wide defaults.  On Unix, the
per-user file is @code{.avrduderc} within the user's home directory.  On
Windows, this file is the @code{avrdude.rc} file located in the same
directory as the executable.

Parts can also inherit parameters from previously defined parts

@subsection Instruction Format

@noindent
Instruction formats are specified as a comma separated list of string
values containing information (bit specifiers) about each of the 32 bits
of the instruction.  Bit specifiers may be one of the following formats:

@table @code

@item 1
The bit is always set on input as well as output

@item 0
the bit is always clear on input as well as output

@item x
the bit is ignored on input and output

@item a
the bit is an address bit, the bit-number matches this bit specifier's
position within the current instruction byte

@item a@var{N}
the bit is the @var{N}th address bit, bit-number = N, i.e., @code{a12}
is address bit 12 on input, @code{a0} is address bit 0.

@item i
the bit is an input data bit

@item o
the bit is an output data bit

@end table

Each instruction must be composed of 32 bit specifiers.  The instruction
specification closely follows the instruction data provided in Atmel's
data sheets for their parts.  For example, the EEPROM read and write
instruction for an AT90S2313 AVR part could be encoded as:

@smallexample

read  = "1  0  1  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x",
        "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   o o o o  o o o o";

write = "1  1  0  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x",
        "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   i i i i  i i i i";

@item
The @code{devicecode} parameter is the device code used by the STK500
and is obtained from the software section (@code{avr061.zip}) of
Atmel's AVR061 application note available from
@url{http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2525.pdf}.

@item
Not all memory types will implement all instructions.

@item
AVR Fuse bits and Lock bits are implemented as a type of memory.

@item
Example memory types are: @code{flash}, @code{eeprom}, @code{fuse},
@code{lfuse} (low fuse), @code{hfuse} (high fuse), @code{efuse}
(extended fuse), @code{signature}, @code{calibration}, @code{lock}.

@item
The memory type specified on the AVRDUDE command line must match one of
the memory types defined for the specified chip.

@item
The @code{pwroff_after_write} flag causes AVRDUDE to attempt to power
the device off and back on after an unsuccessful write to the affected
memory area if VCC programmer pins are defined.  If VCC pins are not
defined for the programmer, a message indicating that the device needs a
power-cycle is printed out.  This flag was added to work around a
problem with the at90s4433/2333's; see the at90s4433 errata at:

         @url{http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc1280.pdf}

@item
The boot loader from application note AVR109 (and thus also the AVR
Butterfly) does not support writing of fuse bits.  Writing lock bits
is supported, but is restricted to the boot lock bits (BLBxx).  These
are restrictions imposed by the underlying SPM instruction that is used
to program the device from inside the boot loader.  Note that programming
the boot lock bits can result in a ``shoot-into-your-foot'' scenario as
the only way to unprogram these bits is a chip erase, which will also
erase the boot loader code.

The boot loader implements the ``chip erase'' function by erasing the
flash pages of the application section.

Reading fuse and lock bits is fully supported.

Ensure the correct socket and routing card are mounted @emph{before}
powering on the STK600.  While the STK600 firmware ensures the socket
and routing card mounted match each other (using a table stored
internally in nonvolatile memory), it cannot handle the case where a
wrong routing card is used, e. g. the routing card
@code{STK600-RC040M-5} (which is meant for 40-pin DIP AVRs that have
an ADC, with the power supply pins in the center of the package) was
used but an ATmega8515 inserted (which uses the ``industry standard''
pinout with Vcc and GND at opposite corners).

Note that for devices that use the routing card @code{STK600-RC008T-2},
in order to use ISP mode, the jumper for @code{AREF0} must be removed
as it would otherwise block one of the ISP signals.  High-voltage
serial programming can be used even with that jumper installed.

The ISP system of the STK600 contains a detection against shortcuts
and other wiring errors.  AVRDUDE initiates a connection check before
trying to enter ISP programming mode, and display the result if the
target is not found ready to be ISP programmed.

High-voltage programming requires the target voltage to be set to at
least 4.5 V in order to work.  This can be done using
@emph{Terminal Mode}, see @ref{Terminal Mode Operation}.

@section Atmel DFU bootloader using FLIP version 1

Bootloaders using the FLIP protocol version 1 experience some very
specific behaviour.

These bootloaders have no option to access memory areas other than
Flash and EEPROM.

When the bootloader is started, it enters a @emph{security mode} where
the only acceptable access is to query the device configuration
parameters (which are used for the signature on AVR devices).  The
only way to leave this mode is a @emph{chip erase}.  As a chip erase
is normally implied by the @option{-U} option when reprogramming the
flash, this peculiarity might not be very obvious immediately.

Sometimes, a bootloader with security mode already disabled seems to
no longer respond with sensible configuration data, but only 0xFF for
all queries.  As these queries are used to obtain the equivalent of a
signature, AVRDUDE can only continue in that situation by forcing the
signature check to be overridden with the @option{-F} option.

A @emph{chip erase} might leave the EEPROM unerased, at least on some
versions of the bootloader.

@section SerialUPDI programmer

SerialUPDI programmer can be used for programming UPDI-only devices
using very simple serial connection.
You can read more about the details here 
@url{https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AVR-Guidance/blob/master/UPDI/jtag2updi.md}

SerialUPDI programmer has been tested using FT232RL USB->UART interface
with the following connection layout (copied from Spence Kohde's page linked
above):

@example
--------------------                                 To Target device
                DTR|                                  __________________

                Gnd|--------------------' 
--------------------
@end example

There are several limitations in current SerialUPDI/AVRDUDE integration,
listed below.

At the end of each run there are fuse values being presented to the user.
For most of the UPDI-enabled devices these definitions (low fuse, high
fuse, extended fuse) have no meaning whatsoever, as they have been 
simply replaced by array of fuses: fuse0..9. Therefore you can simply
ignore this particular line of AVRDUDE output.

Currently available devices support only UPDI NVM programming model 0 
and 2, but there is also experimental implementation of model 3 - not
yet tested.

One of the core AVRDUDE features is verification of the connection by
reading device signature prior to any operation, but this operation
is not possible on UPDI locked devices. Therefore, to be able to 
connect to such a device, you have to provide @option{-F} to override
this check.

Please note: using @option{-F} during write operation to locked device 
will force chip erase. Use carefully.

Another issue you might notice is slow performance of EEPROM writing
using SerialUPDI for AVR Dx devices. This can be addressed by changing
@emph{avrdude.conf} section for this device - changing EEPROM page 
size to 0x20 (instead of default 1), like so:

@example
#------------------------------------------------------------
# AVR128DB28
#------------------------------------------------------------

part parent    ".avrdx"
    id        = "avr128db28";
    desc      = "AVR128DB28";
    signature = 0x1E 0x97 0x0E;

    memory "flash"
        size      = 0x20000;
        offset    = 0x800000;
        page_size = 0x200;
        readsize  = 0x100;
    ;

    memory "eeprom"
        size      = 0x200;
        offset    = 0x1400;
        page_size = 0x1;
        readsize  = 0x100;
    ;
;
@end example

USERROW memory has not been defined for new devices except for 
experimental addition for AVR128DB28. The point of USERROW is to 
provide ability to write configuration details to already locked
device and currently SerialUPDI interface supports this feature,
but it hasn't been tested on wide variety of chips. Treat this as
something experimental at this point. Please note: on locked devices
it's not possible to read back USERROW contents when written, so
the automatic verification will most likely fail and to prevent
error messages, use @option{-V}.

Please note that SerialUPDI interface is pretty new and some
issues are to be expected. In case you run into them, please
make sure to run the intended command with debug output enabled
(@option{-v -v -v}) and provide this verbose output with your
bug report. You can also try to perform the same action using
@emph{pymcuprog} (@url{https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-tools/pymcuprog})
utility with @option{-v debug} and provide its output too.
You will notice that both outputs are pretty similar, and this
was implemented like that on purpose - it was supposed to make
analysis of UPDI protocol quirks easier.

$ gunzip -c avrdude-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd avrdude-@value{VERSION}
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su root -c 'make install'
@end example

The default location of the install is into @code{/usr/local} so you
will need to be sure that @code{/usr/local/bin} is in your @code{PATH}
environment variable.

If you do not have root access to your system, you can do the
following instead:

@example

A Windows executable of avrdude is included in WinAVR which can be found at
@url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr}. WinAVR is a suite of executable, 
open source software development tools for the AVR for the Windows platform.

There are two options to build avrdude from source under Windows.
The first one is to use Cygwin (@url{http://www.cygwin.com/}).

To build and install from the source tarball for Windows (using Cygwin):

@example
$ set PREFIX=<your install directory path>
$ export PREFIX
$ gunzip -c avrdude-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd avrdude-@value{VERSION}
$ ./configure LDFLAGS="-static" --prefix=$PREFIX --datadir=$PREFIX 
--sysconfdir=$PREFIX/bin --enable-versioned-doc=no
$ make
$ make install
@end example

Note that recent versions of Cygwin (starting with 1.7) removed the
MinGW support from the compiler that is needed in order to build a
native Win32 API binary that does not require to install the Cygwin
library @code{cygwin1.dll} at run-time.  Either try using an older
compiler version that still supports MinGW builds, or use MinGW
(@url{http://www.mingw.org/}) directly.

name of the port the corresponds to the base address of the parallel
port that you want.

If the parallel port can be accessed through a different
address, this address can be specified directly, using the common C
language notation (i. e., hexadecimal values are prefixed by @code{0x}).

Problem: I'm using a serial programmer under Windows and get the following
error:

@code{avrdude: serial_open(): can't set attributes for device "com1"},

Solution: This problem seems to appear with certain versions of Cygwin. Specifying
@code{"/dev/com1"} instead of @code{"com1"} should help.


@item
Problem: I'm using Linux and my AVR910 programmer is really slow.

Solution (short): @code{setserial @var{port} low_latency}

Solution (long):
There are two problems here. First, the system may wait some time before it
passes data from the serial port to the program. Under Linux the following
command works around this (you may need root privileges for this).

@code{setserial @var{port} low_latency}

Secondly, the serial interface chip may delay the interrupt for some time.
This behaviour can be changed by setting the FIFO-threshold to one. Under Linux this
can only be done by changing the kernel source in @code{drivers/char/serial.c}.
Search the file for @code{UART_FCR_TRIGGER_8} and replace it with @code{UART_FCR_TRIGGER_1}. Note that overall performance might suffer if there
is high throughput on serial lines. Also note that you are modifying the kernel at
your own risk.


@item
Problem: I'm not using Linux and my AVR910 programmer is really slow.

Solutions: The reasons for this are the same as above.
If you know how to work around this on your OS, please let us know.

@item
Problem: Updating the flash ROM from terminal mode does not work with the
JTAG ICEs.

Solution: None at this time.  Currently, the JTAG ICE code cannot
write to the flash ROM one byte at a time.

@item
Problem: Page-mode programming the EEPROM (using the -U option) does
not erase EEPROM cells before writing, and thus cannot overwrite any
previous value != 0xff.

Solution: None.  This is an inherent feature of the way JTAG EEPROM
programming works, and is documented that way in the Atmel AVR
datasheets.
In order to successfully program the EEPROM that way, a prior chip
erase (with the EESAVE fuse unprogrammed) is required.
This also applies to the STK500 and STK600 in high-voltage programming mode.

@item
Problem: How do I turn off the @var{DWEN} fuse?

Solution: If the @var{DWEN} (debugWire enable) fuse is activated,
the @var{/RESET} pin is not functional anymore, so normal ISP
communication cannot be established.
There are two options to deactivate that fuse again: high-voltage
programming, or getting the JTAG ICE mkII talk debugWire, and
prepare the target AVR to accept normal ISP communication again.

The first option requires a programmer that is capable of high-voltage
programming (either serial or parallel, depending on the AVR device),
for example the STK500.  In high-voltage programming mode, the
@var{/RESET} pin is activated initially using a 12 V pulse (thus the
name @emph{high voltage}), so the target AVR can subsequently be
reprogrammed, and the @var{DWEN} fuse can be cleared.  Typically, this
operation cannot be performed while the AVR is located in the target
circuit though.

The second option requires a JTAG ICE mkII that can talk the debugWire
protocol.  The ICE needs to be connected to the target using the
JTAG-to-ISP adapter, so the JTAG ICE mkII can be used as a debugWire
initiator as well as an ISP programmer.  AVRDUDE will then be activated
using the @var{jtag2isp} programmer type.  The initial ISP
communication attempt will fail, but AVRDUDE then tries to initiate a
debugWire reset.  When successful, this will leave the target AVR in a
state where it can accept standard ISP communication.  The ICE is then
signed off (which will make it signing off from the USB as well), so
AVRDUDE has to be called again afterwards.  This time, standard ISP
communication can work, so the @var{DWEN} fuse can be cleared.

The pin mapping for the JTAG-to-ISP adapter is:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2
@item @strong{JTAG pin} @tab @strong{ISP pin}
@item 1 @tab 3
@item 2 @tab 6
@item 3 @tab 1
@item 4 @tab 2
@item 6 @tab 5
@item 9 @tab 4
@end multitable

@item
Problem: Multiple USBasp or USBtinyISP programmers connected simultaneously are not
found.

Solution: The USBtinyISP code supports distinguishing multiple
programmers based on their bus:device connection tuple that describes
their place in the USB hierarchy on a specific host.  This tuple can
be added to the @var{-P usb} option, similar to adding a serial number
on other USB-based programmers.

The actual naming convention for the bus and device names is
operating-system dependent; AVRDUDE will print out what it found
on the bus when running it with (at least) one @var{-v} option.
By specifying a string that cannot match any existing device
(for example, @var{-P usb:xxx}), the scan will list all possible
candidate devices found on the bus.

Examples:
@example
avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega8 -P usb:003:025 (Linux)
avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega8 -P usb:/dev/usb:/dev/ugen1.3 (FreeBSD 8+)
avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega8 \
  -P usb:bus-0:\\.\libusb0-0001--0x1781-0x0c9f (Windows)
@end example

@item
Problem: I cannot do @dots{} when the target is in debugWire mode.

Solution: debugWire mode imposes several limitations.

The debugWire protocol is Atmel's proprietary one-wire (plus ground)
protocol to allow an in-circuit emulation of the smaller AVR devices,
using the @var{/RESET} line.
DebugWire mode is initiated by activating the @var{DWEN}
fuse, and then power-cycling the target.
While this mode is mainly intended for debugging/emulation, it
also offers limited programming capabilities.
Effectively, the only memory areas that can be read or programmed
in this mode are flash ROM and EEPROM.
It is also possible to read out the signature.
All other memory areas cannot be accessed.
There is no
@emph{chip erase}
functionality in debugWire mode; instead, while reprogramming the
flash ROM, each flash ROM page is erased right before updating it.
This is done transparently by the JTAG ICE mkII (or AVR Dragon).
The only way back from debugWire mode is to initiate a special
sequence of commands to the JTAG ICE mkII (or AVR Dragon), so the
debugWire mode will be temporarily disabled, and the target can
be accessed using normal ISP programming.
This sequence is automatically initiated by using the JTAG ICE mkII
or AVR Dragon in ISP mode, when they detect that ISP mode cannot be
entered.

@item
Problem: I want to use my JTAG ICE mkII to program an
Xmega device through PDI.  The documentation tells me to use the
@emph{XMEGA PDI adapter for JTAGICE mkII} that is supposed to ship
with the kit, yet I don't have it.

Solution: Use the following pin mapping:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2 .2 .2
@item @strong{JTAGICE} @tab @strong{Target} @tab @strong{Squid cab-} @tab @strong{PDI}
@item @strong{mkII probe} @tab @strong{pins} @tab @strong{le colors} @tab @strong{header}

@item
Problem: I want to use my AVR Dragon to program an
Xmega device through PDI.  

Solution: Use the 6 pin ISP header on the Dragon and the following pin mapping:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2
@item @strong{Dragon} @tab @strong{Target}
@item @strong{ISP Header} @tab @strong{pins}
@item 1 (MISO)  @tab PDI_DATA

@end multitable

@item
Problem: I want to use my AVRISP mkII to program an
ATtiny4/5/9/10 device through TPI.  How to connect the pins?

Solution: Use the following pin mapping:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2 .2
@item @strong{AVRISP} @tab @strong{Target} @tab @strong{ATtiny}
@item @strong{connector} @tab @strong{pins} @tab @strong{pin #}
@item 1 (MISO)  @tab TPIDATA  @tab 1
@item 2 (VTref) @tab Vcc      @tab 5

@end multitable

@item
Problem: I want to program an ATtiny4/5/9/10 device using a serial/parallel 
bitbang programmer.  How to connect the pins?

Solution: Since TPI has only 1 pin for bi-directional data transfer, both 
@var{MISO} and @var{MOSI} pins should be connected to the @var{TPIDATA} pin 
on the ATtiny device.
However, a 1K resistor should be placed between the @var{MOSI} and @var{TPIDATA}.
The @var{MISO} pin connects to @var{TPIDATA} directly.
The @var{SCK} pin is connected to @var{TPICLK}.

In addition, the @var{Vcc}, @var{/RESET} and @var{GND} pins should 
be connected to their respective ports on the ATtiny device.

@item
Problem: How can I use a FTDI FT232R USB-to-Serial device for bitbang programming?

Solution: When connecting the FT232 directly to the pins of the target Atmel device, 
the polarity of the pins defined in the @code{programmer} definition should be 
inverted by prefixing a tilde. For example, the @var{dasa} programmer would 
look like this when connected via a FT232R device (notice the tildes in 
front of pins 7, 4, 3 and 8):

@example
programmer
  id    = "dasa_ftdi";
  desc  = "serial port banging, reset=rts sck=dtr mosi=txd miso=cts";
  type  = serbb;
  reset = ~7;
  sck   = ~4;
  mosi  = ~3;
  miso  = ~8;
;
@end example

Note that this uses the FT232 device as a normal serial port, not using the 
FTDI drivers in the special bitbang mode.

@item
Problem: My ATtiny4/5/9/10 reads out fine, but any attempt to program
it (through TPI) fails.  Instead, the memory retains the old contents.

Solution: Mind the limited programming supply voltage range of these
devices.

In-circuit programming through TPI is only guaranteed by the datasheet
at Vcc = 5 V.

@item
Problem: My ATxmega@dots{}A1/A2/A3 cannot be programmed through PDI with
my AVR Dragon.  Programming through a JTAG ICE mkII works though, as does
programming through JTAG.

Solution: None by this time (2010 Q1).

It is said that the AVR Dragon can only program devices from the A4
Xmega sub-family.

@item
Problem: when programming with an AVRISPmkII or STK600, AVRDUDE hangs
when programming files of a certain size (e.g. 246 bytes).  Other
(larger or smaller) sizes work though.

Solution: This is a bug caused by an incorrect handling of zero-length
packets (ZLPs) in some versions of the libusb 0.1 API wrapper that ships
with libusb 1.x in certain Linux distributions.  All Linux systems with
kernel versions < 2.6.31 and libusb >= 1.0.0 < 1.0.3 are reported to be
affected by this.

@item
Problem: after flashing a firmware that reduces the target's clock
speed (e.g. through the @code{CLKPR} register), further ISP connection
attempts fail.

Solution: Even though ISP starts with pulling @var{/RESET} low, the
target continues to run at the internal clock speed as defined by the
firmware running before.  Therefore, the ISP clock speed must be
reduced appropriately (to less than 1/4 of the internal clock speed)
using the -B option before the ISP initialization sequence will
succeed.

As that slows down the entire subsequent ISP session, it might make
sense to just issue a @emph{chip erase} using the slow ISP clock
(option @code{-e}), and then start a new session at higher speed.
Option @code{-D} might be used there, to prevent another unneeded
erase cycle.
