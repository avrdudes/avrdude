@cindex Introduction

AVRDUDE - AVR Downloader Uploader - is a program for downloading and
uploading the on-chip memories of Atmel's AVR microcontrollers. It can
program the Flash, EEPROM, and where supported by the  programmer,  lock
bits, fuses that hold the microcontroller's configuration and other
memories that the part might have.

@cindex @code{calibration}
@cindex @code{signature}
@cindex @code{flash}
@cindex @code{eeprom}
AVRDUDE can be used via the command line to read or write chip memories
(eeprom, flash, fuses, lock bits) and read memories such as signature or
calibration bytes; the same can be achieved via an interactive terminal
mode. Using AVRDUDE from the command line works well for programming the
entire memory of the chip from the contents of a file, while interactive mode
is useful for exploring memory contents, modifying individual bytes of
eeprom, programming fuse/lock bits, etc.

@cindex Programmers supported
@cindex Emulating a HW programmer (dryrun)
@cindex Emulating a bootloader (dryboot)

Programming a microcontroller either requires a physical programmer that
sits between the target chip and the PC running AVRDUDE, or a  bootloader
program on the target chip that is then directly connected to the PC to be
served by AVRDUDE. Currently, AVRDUDE knows about @value{NUMPARTS} parts
and @value{NUMPROGRAMMERS} programmers, though not every programmer can
deal with every part. One noteworthy programmer is @code{dryrun}, which
allows one to explore the AVRDUDE command-line and terminal without
needing to have, or connect, a real physical programmer. Similarly,
@code{dryboot} allows exploring how to communicate with a bootloader
without connecting an AVR part.

AVRDUDE supports the following basic programmer types: Atmel's STK500,
Atmel's AVRISP and AVRISP mkII devices,
Atmel's STK600,
Atmel's JTAG ICE (the original one, mkII, and 3), appnote
avr910, appnote avr109 (including the AVR Butterfly),
serial bit-bang adapters,
and the PPI (parallel port interface). PPI represents a class
of simple programmers where the programming lines are directly
connected to the PC parallel port. Several pin configurations exist
for several variations of the PPI programmers, and AVRDUDE can be
configured to work with them by either specifying the appropriate
programmer on the command line or by creating a new entry in its
configuration file. All that's usually required for a new entry is to
tell AVRDUDE which pins to use for each programming function.

A number of equally simple bit-bang programming adapters that connect
to a serial port are supported as well, among them the popular
Ponyprog serial adapter, and the DASA and DASA3 adapters that used to
be supported by uisp(1).  Note that these adapters are meant to be
attached to a physical serial port.  Connecting to a serial port
emulated on top of USB is likely to not work at all, or to work
abysmally slow.

If you happen to have a Linux system with at least 4 hardware GPIOs
available (like almost all embedded Linux boards) you can do without any
additional hardware - just connect them to the SDO, SDI, RESET and SCK
pins of the AVR's SPI interface and use the linuxgpio programmer
type. Older boards might use the labels MOSI for SDO and MISO for SDI. It bitbangs
the lines using the Linux sysfs GPIO interface. Of course, care should
be taken about voltage level compatibility. Also, although not strictly
required, it is strongly advisable to protect the GPIO pins from
overcurrent situations in some way. The simplest would be to just put
some resistors in series or better yet use a 3-state buffer driver like
the 74HC244. Have a look at
@url{https://kolev.info/blog/2013/01/06/avrdude-linuxgpio/} for a more
detailed tutorial about using this programmer type.

Under a Linux installation with direct access to the SPI bus and GPIO
pins, such as would be found on a Raspberry Pi, the ``linuxspi''
programmer type can be used to directly connect to and program a chip
using the built in interfaces on the computer. The requirements to use
this type are that an SPI interface is exposed along with one GPIO
pin. The GPIO serves as the reset output since the Linux SPI drivers
do not hold chip select down when a transfer is not occuring and thus
it cannot be used as the reset pin. A readily available level
translator should be used between the SPI bus/reset GPIO and the chip
to avoid potentially damaging the computer's SPI controller in the
event that the chip is running at 5V and the SPI runs at 3.3V. The
GPIO chosen for reset can be configured in the avrdude configuration
file using the @code{reset} entry under the linuxspi programmer, or
directly in the port specification. An external pull-up resistor
should be connected between the AVR's reset pin and Vcc. If Vcc is not
the same as the SPI voltage, this should be done on the AVR side of
the level translator to protect the hardware from damage.

On a Raspberry Pi, header J8 provides access to the SPI and GPIO
lines.

Typically, pins 19, 21, and 23 are SPI SDO, SDI, and SCK, while
pins 24 and 26 would serve as CE outputs. So, close to these pins
is pin 22 as GPIO25 which can be used as /RESET, and pin 25 can
be used as GND.

A typical programming cable would then look like:

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15 .3
@item @code{J8 pin} @tab @code{ISP pin} @tab @code{Name}
@item @code{21}     @tab @code{1}   @tab @code{SDI}
@item @code{-}      @tab @code{2}   @tab @code{Vcc - leave open}
@item @code{23}     @tab @code{3}   @tab @code{SCK}
@item @code{19}     @tab @code{4}   @tab @code{SDO}
@item @code{22}     @tab @code{5}   @tab @code{/RESET}
@item @code{25}     @tab @code{6}   @tab @code{GND}
@end multitable

(Mind the 3.3 V voltage level of the Raspberry Pi!)

The @code{-P @var{portname}} option defaults to
@code{/dev/spidev0.0:/dev/gpiochip0} for this programmer.

@cindex Atmel STK500

@cindex Atmel AVR JTAGICE3

@cindex FT232R Synchronous BitBang
@cindex FT245R programmer

@cindex USBtiny simple USB programmer
The STK600, JTAG ICE mkII/3, AVRISP mkII, USBasp, avrftdi (and derivatives), and USBtinyISP
programmers communicate through the USB, using @code{libusb} as a
platform abstraction layer.
The avrftdi adds support for the FT2232C/D, FT2232H, and FT4232H devices. These all use
the MPSSE mode, which has a specific pin mapping. Bit 0 (the lsb of the byte in the config
file) is SCK. Bit 1 is SDO, and Bit 2 is SDI. Bit 3 usually reset. The 2232C/D parts
are only supported on interface A, but the H parts can be either A or B (specified by the
usbdev config parameter).
The STK500, STK600, JTAG ICE, and avr910 contain on-board logic to control the programming of the target
device.
@cindex Atmel bootloader (AVR109, AVR911)
@cindex @code{flash}
The avr109 bootloader implements a protocol similar to avr910, but is
actually implemented in the boot area of the target's flash, as
opposed to being an external device.
The fundamental difference between the two types lies in the
protocol used to control the programmer. The avr910 protocol is very
simplistic and can easily be used as the basis for a simple, home made
programmer since the firmware is available online. On the other hand,
the STK500 protocol is more robust and complicated and the firmware is
not openly available.
The JTAG ICE also uses a serial communication protocol which is similar
to the STK500 firmware version 2 one.  However, as the JTAG ICE is
intended to allow on-chip debugging as well as memory programming, the
protocol is more sophisticated.
(The JTAG ICE mkII protocol can also be run on top of USB.)
Only the memory programming functionality of the JTAG ICE is supported
by AVRDUDE.
@cindex debugWIRE
@cindex ISP
@cindex PDI
@cindex JTAG
@cindex Atmel JTAG ICE mkII
@cindex Atmel AVR JTAGICE3
@cindex JTAG ICE mkII
@cindex AVR JTAGICE3
@cindex JTAGICE3
For the JTAG ICE mkII/3, JTAG, debugWIRE and ISP mode are supported, provided
it has a firmware revision of at least 4.14 (decimal).
See below for the limitations of debugWIRE.
For ATxmega devices, the JTAG ICE mkII/3 is supported in PDI mode (Xmega
parts), provided it has a revision 1 hardware and firmware version of at
least 5.37 (decimal).

@cindex Atmel-ICE
The Atmel-ICE (ARM/AVR) is supported (JTAG, PDI, debugWIRE, ISP, UPDI).

@cindex Atmel XplainedPro
@cindex XplainedPro
Atmel's XplainedPro boards, using EDBG protocol (CMSIS-DAP compliant), are
supported by the ``jtag3'' programmer type.

@cindex Atmel XplainedMini
@cindex XplainedMini
Atmel's XplainedMini boards, using mEDBG protocol, are also
supported by the ``jtag3'' programmer type.

@cindex Atmel AVR Dragon
@cindex AVR Dragon
@cindex Dragon
The AVR Dragon is supported in all modes (ISP, JTAG, PDI, HVSP, PP, debugWIRE).
When used in JTAG and debugWIRE mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to a
JTAG ICE mkII, so all device-specific comments for that device
will apply as well.
When used in ISP and PDI mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to an
AVRISP mkII (or JTAG ICE mkII in ISP mode), so all device-specific
comments will apply there.
In particular, the Dragon starts out with a rather fast ISP clock
frequency, so the @code{-B @var{bitclock}}
option might be required to achieve a stable ISP communication.
For ATxmega devices, the AVR Dragon is supported in PDI mode, provided it
has a firmware version of at least 6.11 (decimal).

@cindex Wiring bootloader
Wiring boards (e.g. Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3) are supported, utilizing
STK500 V2.x protocol, but a simple DTR/RTS toggle to set the boards
into programming mode.  The programmer type is ``wiring''. Note that
the @code{-D} option will likely be required in this case, because the
bootloader will rewrite the program memory, but no true chip erase can
be performed.

@cindex Arduino bootloader
Serial bootloaders that run a skeleton of the STK500 1.x protocol are supported via
their own programmer type specification ``arduino''.  This programmer works for
the Arduino Uno Rev3 or any AVR that runs the Optiboot bootloader.
The number of connection retry attempts can be specified as an
extended parameter. See the section on
@emph{extended parameters}
below for details.

@cindex Urboot bootloader
@cindex Urclock programmer
@cindex Urprotocol
Urprotocol is a leaner version of the STK500 1.x protocol that is designed
to be backwards compatible with STK500 v1.x; it allows bootloaders to be
much smaller, e.g., as implemented in the urboot project
@url{https://github.com/stefanrueger/urboot}. The programmer type ``urclock''
caters for these urboot bootloaders. Owing to its backward compatibility,
bootloaders that can be served by the arduino programmer can normally also
be served by the urclock programmer. This may require specifying the size
of (to AVRDUDE) @emph{unknown} bootloaders in bytes using the @code{-x
bootsize=<n>} option, which is necessary for the urclock programmer to
enable it to protect the bootloader from being overwritten. If an unknown
bootloader has EEPROM read/write capability then the option @code{-x eepromrw}
informs @code{avrdude -c urclock} of that capability.

@cindex The Bus Pirate
The BusPirate is a versatile tool that can also be used as an AVR programmer.
A single BusPirate can be connected to up to 3 independent AVRs. See
the section on
@emph{extended parameters}
below for details.

@cindex CH341A programmer
The USBasp ISP, USBtinyISP and CH341A adapters are also supported, provided
AVRDUDE has been compiled with libusb support.
They former two feature simple firmware-only USB implementations, running on
an ATmega8 (or ATmega88), or ATtiny2313, respectively.
CH341A programmers connect directly to the AVR target. Their SPI bit clock
is approximately 1.7@w{ }MHz and cannot be changed. As a consequence, the
AVR target must have a CPU frequency of 6.8@w{ }MHz or more: factory-set
AVR parts, which typically run on an internal oscillator between 1 MHz and
1.6 MHz, cannot be programmed using @code{-c ch341a}.

@cindex FLIP bootloader
The Atmel DFU bootloader is supported in both, FLIP protocol version 1
(AT90USB* and ATmega*U* devices), as well as version 2 (Xmega devices).
See below for some hints about FLIP version 1 protocol behaviour.

@cindex MPLAB(R) PICkit 4
@cindex MPLAB(R) PICkit 5
@cindex MPLAB(R) SNAP
@cindex PICkit 4
@cindex PICkit 5
@cindex SNAP
The MPLAB(R) PICkit 4/5 and MPLAB(R) SNAP are supported in JTAG, TPI, ISP, PDI and UPDI mode.
@cindex Curiosity nano
The Curiosity Nano board is supported in UPDI mode. It is dubbed ``PICkit on
Board'', thus the name @code{pkobn_updi}.

@cindex SerialUPDI
SerialUPDI programmer implementation is based on Microchip's
@emph{pymcuprog} (@url{https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-tools/pymcuprog})
utility, but it also contains some performance improvements included in
Spence Konde's @emph{DxCore} Arduino core (@url{https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore}).
In a nutshell, this programmer consists of simple USB-to-UART adapter, diode
and couple of resistors. It uses serial connection to provide UPDI interface.
@xref{SerialUPDI Programmer} for more details and known issues.

The jtag2updi programmer is supported,
and can program AVRs with a UPDI interface.
Jtag2updi is just a firmware that can be loaded onto an AVR,
which enables it to interface with avrdude using the jtagice mkii protocol
via a serial link (@url{https://github.com/ElTangas/jtag2updi}).

@cindex Micronucleus bootloader
@cindex @code{flash}
The Micronucleus bootloader is supported for both protocol version V1 and
V2. As the bootloader does not support reading from flash memory, use the
@code{-V} option to prevent AVRDUDE from verifying the flash memory. See
the section on @emph{extended parameters} below for Micronucleus specific
options.

@cindex Teensy bootloader
@cindex @code{flash}
The Teensy bootloader is supported for all AVR boards.
As the bootloader does not support reading from flash memory,
use the @code{-V} option to prevent AVRDUDE from verifying the flash memory.
See the section on @emph{extended parameters}
below for Teensy specific options.

AVRDUDE was written by Brian S. Dean under the name of AVRPROG to run on
the FreeBSD Operating System.  Brian renamed the software to be called
AVRDUDE when interest grew in a Windows port of the software so that the
name did not conflict with AVRPROG.EXE which is the name of Atmel's
Windows programming software.

For many years, the AVRDUDE source resided in public repositories on
savannah.nongnu.org,
where it continued to be enhanced and ported to other systems.  In
addition to FreeBSD, AVRDUDE now runs on Linux, macOS and Windows.  The
developers behind the porting effort primarily were Ted Roth, Eric
Weddington, and J@"org Wunsch.

In 2022, the project moved to Github (@url{https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude/}).

And in the spirit of many open source projects, this manual also draws
on the work of others.  The initial revision was composed of parts of
the original Unix manual page written by J@"org Wunsch, the original web
site documentation by Brian Dean, and from the comments describing the
fields in the AVRDUDE configuration file by Brian Dean.  The texi
formatting was modeled after that of the Simulavr documentation by Ted
Roth.

@noindent
AVRDUDE is a command line tool, used as follows:

@smallexample
avrdude -p partno @var{options} @dots{}
@end smallexample

@noindent
Command line options are used to control AVRDUDE's behaviour.  The
following options are recognized:

@table @code
@item -p @var{partno}
@cindex Option @code{-p} @var{partno}
@cindex @code{-p} @var{partno}

This option tells AVRDUDE what part (MCU) is connected to the programmer.
The @var{partno} parameter is the part's id listed in the configuration
file. To see a list of currently supported MCUs use @code{?} as partno,
which will, for each part, print its id; its official part name;
alternative names, if any; and the list of available programming
interfaces. In connection with @code{-v}, this will also print a table of
variant part names with the package code and some absolute maximum
ratings. The part id, their official part name, the listed alternative
names or any of the full variant part names can be used to specify a part
with the @code{-p} option. If a part is unknown to AVRDUDE, it means that
there is no config file entry for that part, but it can be added to the
configuration file if you have the Atmel datasheet so that you can enter
the programming specifications. If @code{-p ?} is specified with a
specific programmer, see @code{-c} below, then only those parts are output
that the programmer expects to be able to handle, together with the
programming interface(s) that can be used in that combination. In reality
there can be deviations from this list, particularly if programming is
directly via a bootloader. See @ref{List of Parts} for a full and detailed
listing of supported parts.

@item -p @var{wildcard/flags}
@cindex Option @code{-p} @var{wildcard/flags}
@cindex @code{-p} @var{wildcard/flags}
Run developer options for MCUs that are matched by @var{wildcard}. Whilst
their main use is for developers some @var{flags} can be of utility for
users, e.g.,  @code{avrdude -p m328p/S} outputs AVRDUDE's understanding of
ATmega328P MCU properties; for more information run @code{avrdude -p x/h}.

@item -b @var{baudrate}
@cindex Option @code{-b} @var{baudrate}
@cindex @code{-b} @var{baudrate}
Override the RS-232 connection baud rate specified in the respective
programmer's @code{baudrate} entry of the configuration file
or defined by the @code{default_baudrate} entry in your
@code{~/.config/avrdude/avrdude.rc} or @code{~/.avrduderc} configuration
file if no @code{baudrate} entry was provided for this programmer.

@item -B @var{bitclock}
@cindex Option @code{-B} @var{bitclock}
@cindex @code{-B} @var{bitclock}
Specify the bit clock period for the JTAG, PDI, TPI, UPDI, or ISP
interface. The value is a floating-point number in microseconds.
Alternatively, the value might be suffixed with Hz, kHz or
MHz in order to specify the bit clock frequency rather than a
period. Some programmers default their bit clock value to a 1
microsecond bit clock period, suitable for target MCUs running at 4
MHz clock and above. Slower MCUs need a correspondingly higher bit
clock period. Some programmers reset their bit clock value to the
default value when the programming software signs off, whilst
others store the last used bit clock value. It is recommended to
always specify the bit clock if read/write speed is important.  You
can use the 'default_bitclock' keyword in your
@code{~/.config/avrdude/avrdude.rc} or @code{~/.avrduderc}
configuration file to assign a default value to keep from having to
specify this option on every invocation.

Note that some official Microchip programmers store the bitclock setting
and will continue to use it until a different value is provided. This
applies to 2nd generation programmers (AVRISPmkII, AVR Dragon, JTAG ICE
mkII, STK600) and 3rd generation programmers (JTAGICE3, Atmel ICE, Power
Debugger). 4th generation programmers (PICkit 4, MPLAB(R) SNAP) will store
the last user-specified bitclock until the programmer is disconnected from
the computer.

@item -c @var{programmer-id}
@cindex Option @code{-c} @var{programmer-id}
@cindex @code{-c} @var{programmer-id}

Specify the programmer to be used.  AVRDUDE knows about quite a few
programmers. The @var{programmer-id} parameter is the programmer's id
listed in the configuration file.  Specify @code{-c ?} to list all
programmers in the configuration file. If you have a programmer that is
unknown to AVRDUDE but related to a known programmer there is some chance
that it can be added to the configuration file without any code changes to
AVRDUDE: copy a similar entry and change those features that differ to
match that of the unknown programmer. If @code{-c ?} is specified with a
specific part, see @code{-p} above, then only those programmers are output
that expect to be able to handle this part, together with the programming
interface(s) that can be used in that combination. In reality there can be
deviations from this list, particularly if programming is directly via a
bootloader. See @ref{List of Programmers} for a full and detailed listing
of known programmers.

@item -c @var{wildcard/flags}
@cindex Option @code{-c} @var{wildcard/flags}
@cindex @code{-c} @var{wildcard/flags}
Run developer options for programmers that are matched by @var{wildcard}.
Whilst their main use is for developers some @var{flags} can be of utility
for users, e.g., @code{avrdude -c usbtiny/S} shows AVRDUDE's understanding of
usbtiny's properties; for more information run @code{avrdude -c x/h}.

@item -C @var{config-file}
@cindex Option @code{-C} @var{config-file}
@cindex @code{-C} @var{config-file}
@cindex Configuration files
Use the specified config file for configuration data.  This file
contains all programmer and part definitions that AVRDUDE knows about.
If not specified, AVRDUDE looks for the configuration file in the following
two locations:

@enumerate

@item
@code{<directory from which application loaded>/../etc/avrdude.conf}

@item
@code{<directory from which application loaded>/avrdude.conf}

@end enumerate

If not found there, the lookup procedure becomes platform dependent. On FreeBSD
and Linux, AVRDUDE looks at @code{/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf}. See Appendix A
for the method of searching on Windows.

If @var{config-file} is written as @var{+filename}
then this file is read after the system wide and user configuration
files. This can be used to add entries to the configuration
without patching your system wide configuration file. It can be used
several times, the files are read in same order as given on the command
line.

@item -N
@cindex Option @code{-N}
@cindex @code{-N}
Do not load the personal configuration file that is usually located at
@code{~/.config/avrdude/avrdude.rc}, @code{~/.avrduderc} or in the same
directory as the avrdude executable.

@item -A
@cindex Option @code{-A}
@cindex @code{-A}
@cindex @code{flash}
Disable the automatic removal of trailing-0xFF sequences in file input
that is to be programmed to flash and in AVR reads from flash memory.
Normally, trailing 0xFFs can be discarded, as flash programming requires
the memory be erased to 0xFF beforehand. @code{-A} should be used when the
programmer hardware, or bootloader software for that matter, does not
carry out chip erase and instead handles the memory erase on a page level.
The popular Arduino bootloader exhibits this behaviour; for this reason
@code{-A} is engaged by default when specifying @code{-c} arduino.

@item -D
@cindex Option @code{-D}
@cindex @code{-D}
@cindex @code{flash}
Disable auto-erase for flash. When the @code{-U} option for writing to any
flash memory is specified, avrdude will perform a chip erase before
starting any of the programming operations, since it generally is a
mistake to program the flash without performing an erase first.  This
option disables that. Auto-erase is not used for ATxmega parts nor for the
UPDI (AVR8X family) parts as these can use page erase before writing each
page so no explicit chip erase is required. Note, however, that any flash
page not affected by the current operation will retain its previous
contents. Setting @code{-D} implies @code{-A}.

@item -e
@cindex Option @code{-e}
@cindex @code{-e}
@cindex @code{flash}
@cindex @code{eeprom}
Causes a chip erase to be executed. This will reset the contents of the
flash ROM and EEPROM to the value @code{0xff}, and clear all lock bits.
Except for ATxmega and UPDI (AVR8X family) devices, all of which can use
page erase, it is basically a prerequisite command before the flash ROM
can be reprogrammed again.  The only exception would be if the new
contents would exclusively cause bits to be programmed from the value
@code{1} to @code{0}.  This option carries out the chip erase at the
beginning, before any of the @code{-U}, @code{-T} or @code{-t} options are
processed. If a chip erase is required in at a certain position within the
sequence of @code{-U}, @code{-T} or @code{-t} options it is recommended to
use @code{-T} erase instead which is processed in the given command line
order.

@cindex Auto-erase
@cindex @code{flash}
In absence of an explicit @code{-e} or @code{-D} option avrdude tries to
augur from the command line whether or not the chip should be auto-erased
at the  beginning. If avrdude detects a @code{-U} command that writes to
flash then auto-erase will be carried out before any other programming
unless a @code{-T} erase commad has been detected beforehand and unless
flash is read before writing to it. For the purpose of this analysis any
terminal command is considered to possibly read flash.

@cindex @code{eeprom}
Note that for reprogramming EEPROM cells, no explicit prior chip erase is
required since the MCU provides an auto-erase cycle in that case before
programming the cell.

@item -E @var{exitspec}[,@dots{}]
@cindex Option @code{-E} @var{exitspec}[,@dots{}]
@cindex @code{-E} @var{exitspec}[,@dots{}]
Pass @var{exitspec} to the programmer. The interpretation of the exitspec
parameter depends on the programmer itself. See below for a list of
programmers accepting exitspec parameter options or issue
@code{avrdude -E help ...} to see the  options for the programmer.

Multiple @var{exitspec} options can be separated with commas.

@item -F
@cindex Option @code{-F}
@cindex @code{-F}
@cindex @code{signature}
Normally, AVRDUDE tries to verify that the device signature read from
the part is reasonable before continuing.  Since it can happen from time
to time that a device has a broken (erased or overwritten) device
signature but is otherwise operating normally, this options is provided
to override the check.
Also, for programmers like the Atmel STK500 and STK600 which can
adjust parameters local to the programming tool (independent of an
actual connection to a target controller), this option can be used
together with @option{-t} to continue in terminal mode.
Moreover, the option allows to continue despite failed initialization
of connection between a programmer and a target.

@item -i @var{delay}
@cindex Option @code{-i} @var{delay}
@cindex @code{-i} @var{delay}
For bitbang-type programmers, delay for approximately
@var{delay}
microseconds between each bit state change.
If the host system is very fast, or the target runs off a slow clock
(like a 32 kHz crystal, or the 128 kHz internal RC oscillator), this
can become necessary to satisfy the requirement that the ISP clock
frequency must not be higher than 1/4 of the CPU clock frequency.
This is implemented as a spin-loop delay to allow even for very
short delays.
On Unix-style operating systems, the spin loop is initially calibrated
against a system timer, so the number of microseconds might be rather
realistic, assuming a constant system load while AVRDUDE is running.
On Win32 operating systems, a preconfigured number of cycles per
microsecond is assumed that might be off a bit for very fast or very
slow machines.

@item -l @var{logfile}
@cindex Option @code{-l} @var{logfile}
@cindex @code{-l} @var{logfile}
Use @var{logfile} rather than @var{stderr} for diagnostics output.
Note that initial diagnostic messages (during option parsing) are still
written to @var{stderr} anyway.

@item -n
@cindex Option @code{-n}
@cindex @code{-n}
No-write: disables writing data to the MCU whilst processing @code{-U}
(useful for debugging AVRDUDE). The terminal mode continues to write to
the device.

@item -O
@cindex Option @code{-O}
@cindex @code{-O}
@cindex @code{calibration}
Perform a RC oscillator run-time calibration according to Atmel
application note AVR053.
This is only supported on the STK500v2, AVRISP mkII, and JTAG ICE mkII
hardware.
@cindex @code{eeprom}
Note that the result will be stored in the EEPROM cell at address 0.

@item -P @var{port}
@cindex Option @code{-P} @var{port}
@cindex @code{-P} @var{port}

Use @var{port} to identify the connection through which the programmer is
attached. This can be a parallel, serial, spi or linuxgpio connection. The
programmer normally specifies the connection type; in absence of a @code{-P}
specification, system-dependent default values @code{default_parallel},
@code{default_serial}, @code{default_spi}, or @code{default_linuxgpio} from
the configuration file are used. If you need to use a different port, use this
option to specify the alternate port name.

If avrdude has been configured with libserialport support, a serial port can
be specified using a predefined serial adapter type in @var{avrdude.conf} or
@var{.avrduderc}, e.g., @code{ch340} or @code{ft232r}. If more than one serial
adapter of the same type is connected, they can be distinguished by appending
a serial number, e.g., @code{ft232r:12345678}. Note that the USB to serial
chip has to have a serial number for this to work. Avrdude can check for
leading and trailing serial number matches as well. In the above example,
@code{ft232r:1234} would also result in a match, and so would
@code{ft232r:...5678}. If the USB to serial chip is not known to avrdude, it
can be specified using the hexadecimal USB vendor ID, hexadecimal product ID
and an optional serial number, following the serial number matching rules
described above, e.g., @code{usb:0x2341:0x0043} or
@code{usb:2341:0043:12345678}. To see a list of currently plugged-in serial
ports use @code{-P ?s}. In order to see a list of all possible serial adapters
known to avrdude use @code{-P ?sa}.

For the JTAG ICE mkII, if AVRDUDE has been built with libusb support,
@var{port} may alternatively be specified as
@code{usb}[:@var{serialno}].  In that case, the JTAG ICE mkII will be
looked up on USB.  If @var{serialno} is also specified, it will be
matched against the serial number read from any JTAG ICE mkII found on
USB.  The match is done after stripping any existing colons from the
given serial number, and right-to-left, so only the least significant
bytes from the serial number need to be given.
For a trick how to find out the serial numbers of all JTAG ICEs
attached to USB, see @ref{Example Command Line Invocations}.

As the AVRISP mkII device can only be talked to over USB, the very
same method of specifying the port is required there.

For the USB programmer "AVR-Doper" running in HID mode, the port must
be specified as @var{avrdoper}. Libhidapi support is required on Unix
and Mac OS but not on Windows. For more information about AVR-Doper see
@url{https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/avrdoper.html}.

For the USBtinyISP, which is a simplistic device not implementing
serial numbers, multiple devices can be distinguished by their
location in the USB hierarchy.
For USBasp, multiple devices can be distinguished by either USB connection
or serial number.
See the respective @ref{Troubleshooting} entry for examples.

For the XBee programmer the target MCU is to be programmed wirelessly
over a ZigBee mesh using the XBeeBoot bootloader.  The ZigBee 64-bit
address for the target MCU's own XBee device must be supplied as a
16-character hexadecimal value as a port prefix, followed by the
@code{@@} character, and the serial device to connect to a second
directly contactable XBee device associated with the same mesh (with
a default baud rate of 9600).  This may look similar to:
@code{0013a20000000001@/dev/tty.serial}.

For diagnostic purposes, if the target MCU with an XBeeBoot
bootloader is connected directly to the serial port, the
64-bit address field can be omitted.  In this mode the
default baud rate will be 19200.

For programmers that attach to a serial port using some kind of
higher level protocol (as opposed to bit-bang style programmers),
@var{port} can be specified as @code{net}:@var{host}:@var{port}.
In this case, instead of trying to open a local device, a TCP
network connection to (TCP) @var{port} on @var{host}
is established.
Square brackets may be placed around @var{host} to improve
readability for numeric IPv6 addresses (e.g.
@code{net:[2001:db8::42]:1337}).
The remote endpoint is assumed to be a terminal or console server
that connects the network stream to a local serial port where the
actual programmer has been attached to.
The port is assumed to be properly configured, for example using a
transparent 8-bit data connection without parity at 115200 Baud
for a STK500.

Note: The ability to handle IPv6 hostnames and addresses is limited to
Posix systems (by now).

@item -r
@cindex Option @code{-r}
@cindex @code{-r}
Opens the serial port at 1200 baud and immediately closes it, waits 400 ms
for each @code{-r} on the command line and then establishes communication
with the programmer. This is commonly known as a "1200bps touch", and is
used to trigger programming mode for certain boards like Arduino Leonardo,
Arduino Micro/Pro Micro and the Arduino Nano Every. Longer waits, and
therefore multiple @code{-r} options, are sometimes needed for slower, less
powerful hosts.

@item -q
@cindex Option @code{-q}
@cindex @code{-q}
Disable (or quell) output of the progress bar while reading or writing
to the device.  Specify it a second time for even quieter operation.

@item -s, -u
@cindex Option @code{-s}, @code{-u}
@cindex @code{-s}, @code{-u}
These options used to control the obsolete "safemode" feature which
is no longer present. They are silently ignored for backwards compatibility.

@item -T @var{cmd}
@cindex Option @code{-T} @var{cmd}
@cindex @code{-T} @var{cmd}
Run terminal line @var{cmd} when it is its turn in relation to other
@code{-t} interactive terminals, @code{-T} terminal commands and
@code{-U} memory operations. Except for the simplest of terminal commands
the argument @var{cmd} will most likely need to be set in quotes, see your
OS shell manual for details. See below for a detailed description of all
terminal commands.

@item -t
@cindex Option @code{-t}
@cindex @code{-t}
Tells AVRDUDE to run an interactive terminal when it is its turn in
relation to other @code{-t} interactive terminals, @code{-T}
terminal commands and @code{-U} memory operations.

@item -U @var{memory}:@var{op}:@var{filename}[:@var{format}]
@cindex Option @code{-U} @var{memory}:@var{op}:@var{filename}[:@var{format}]
@cindex @code{-U} @var{memory}:@var{op}:@var{filename}[:@var{format}]

Perform a memory operation when it is its turn in relation to other
@code{-t} interactive terminals, @code{-T} terminal commands and @code{-U}
memory operations. The @var{memory} field specifies the memory type to
operate on. From version 8.0 the memory field can also be a
comma-separated list of memories, eg, @code{flash,eeprom}; also, Intel Hex
or Motorola S-Record files generated by AVRDUDE can store multiple
memories. The special memory @code{ALL} expands to all memories that a
part has while @code{all} expands to all memories with exception of
sub-memories. @code{etc} is the same as @code{all}; this can be used to
change the order in which memories are written to or read from file, eg,
@code{signature,etc} is a list of all memories such that the
@code{signature} memory comes first. It is possible to remove a memory
from the list so far by preceding a minus or backslash, eg,
@code{all,-calibration}. Use the @option{-T part} option on the command
line or the @code{part} command in the interactive terminal to display all
the memories supported by a particular device.

@cindex @code{calibration}
@cindex @code{signature}
@cindex @code{flash}
@cindex @code{eeprom}
Typically, a device's memory configuration at least contains the memory
types @code{flash}, @code{eeprom}, @code{signature} and @code{lock}, which
is sometimes known as @code{lockbits}. The signature memory contains the
three device signature bytes, which should be, but not always are, unique
for the part. The @code{lock} memory of one or four bytes typically
details whether or not external reading/writing of the flash memory, or
parts of it, is allowed. After restricting access via the lock memory,
often the only way to unlock memory is via a chip erase.  Parts will also
typically have fuse bytes, which are read/write memories for configuration
of the device and calibration memories that typically contain read-only
factory calibration values.

@cindex @code{flash}
@cindex @code{eeprom}
The flash memory, being physically implemented as NOR-memory, is special
in the sense that it is normally only possible to program bits to change
from 1 to 0. Before reprogramming takes place normally flash memory has to
be erased. Older parts would only offer a chip erase to do so, which also
erases EEPROM unless a fuse configuration preserves its contents. If
AVRDUDE detects a @code{-U} option that writes to a flash memory it might
automatically trigger a chip erase for these older parts. See the
description of auto-erase under the @code{-e} option above. ATxmegas or
UPDI parts (AVR8X family) offer a page erase, and AVRDUDE takes advantage
of that by erasing pages before programming them unless @code{-e} (chip
erase) or @code{-D} (do not erase before writing) was requested. It should
be noted that in absence of the @code{-e} chip erase option any ATxmega or
UPDI flash pages not affected by the programming will retain their
previous content.

See @ref{List of Memories} for a complete list of memories that AVR
devices can have.

The @var{op} field specifies what operation to perform:

@table @code
@item r
read device memories and write to the specified file

@item w
read data from the specified file and write to the device memories in the
list; read-only memories in a memory list are skipped, as are fuses and
lock bits when the programmer is a bootloader; writing to single read-only
memories fails only if the contents differs between the file and memory

@item v
read data from both the device and the specified file and perform a verify

@end table

The @var{filename} field indicates the name of the file to read or
write.  The @var{format} field is optional and contains the format of
the file to read or write.  Possible values are:

@table @code
@cindex Intel Hex
@item i
Intel Hex

@item I
Intel Hex with comments on reading from, and tolerance of checksum errors, writing to the AVR

@cindex Motorola S-Record
@item s
Motorola S-Record

@cindex @code{flash}
@cindex Raw binary
@item r
raw binary; little-endian byte order, in the case of the flash data

@cindex ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)
@item e
ELF (Executable and Linkable Format), the final output file from the
linker; currently only accepted as an input file

@cindex Immediate file mode
@item m
immediate mode; actual byte values are specified on the command line,
separated by commas or spaces in place of the @var{filename} field of the
@option{-U} option.  This is useful for programming fuse bytes without
having to create a single-byte file or enter terminal mode.

@cindex Auto-detect mode
@item a
auto detect; valid for input only, and only if the input is not provided
at stdin.

@cindex Decimal file mode
@item d
decimal; this and the following formats generate one line of output for
the respective memory section, forming a comma-separated list of the
values. This can be particularly useful for subsequent processing, like
for fuse bit settings.

@cindex Hexadecimal file mode
@item h
hexadecimal; each value will get the string @emph{0x} prepended.

@cindex Octal file mode
@item o
octal; each value will get a @emph{0}
prepended unless it is less than 8 in which case it gets no prefix.

@cindex Binary file mode
@item b
binary; each value will get the string @emph{0b} prepended.
@end table

When used as input, the @code{m}, @code{d}, @code{h}, @code{o} and
@code{b} formats will use the same code for reading lists of numbers
separated by white space and/or commas. The read routine handles decimal,
hexadecimal, octal or binary numbers on a number-by-number basis, and the
list of numbers can therefore be of mixed type. In fact the syntax, is the
same as for data used by the terminal write command, i.e., the file's input
data can also be 2-byte short integers, 4-byte long integers or 8-byte
long long integers, 4-byte floating point numbers, 8-byte double precision
numbers, C-type strings with a terminating nul or C-like characters such
as @code{'\t'}. Numbers are written as little endian to memory. When using
@code{0x} hexadecimal or @code{0b} binary input leading zeros are used to
determine the size of the integer, e.g., @code{0x002a} will occupy two
bytes and write a @code{0x2a} to memory followed by @code{0x00}, while
@code{0x01234} will occupy 4 bytes. See the description of the terminal
write command for more details.

In absence of an explicit file format, the default is to use auto
detection for input files, raw binary format for output files from a
single memory read and Intel Hex with comments when an output file is
generated from a list of memories. Note that while AVRDUDE will generate a
single output file from a memory list for all formats with the exception
of elf (@code{:e}) it only recognises Intel hex (@code{:I} or @code{:i}),
Motorola S-Record (@code{:s}) or elf files (@code{:e}, generated by the
compiler) as valid multi-memory files when reading a file for verifying or
writing memories. Note also that if a @var{filename} contains a colon as
penultimate character the @var{format} field is no longer optional since
the last character would otherwise be misinterpreted as @var{format}.

@cindex @code{flash}
When reading any kind of flash memory area (including the various sub-areas
in Xmega devices), the resulting output file will be truncated to not contain
trailing 0xFF bytes which indicate unprogrammed (erased) memory. Thus, if the
entire memory is unprogrammed, this will result in an output file that has no
contents at all. This behaviour can be overridden with the @code{-A} option.

@cindex @code{flash}
As an abbreviation, the form @code{-U} @var{filename}
is equivalent to specifying
@code{-U} @emph{flash:w:}@var{filename}@emph{:a} or
@code{-U} @emph{application:w:}@var{filename}@emph{:a} for ATxmegas.
This will only work if @var{filename} does not have a pair of colons in it
that sandwich a single character as otherwise the first part might be
interpreted as memory, and the single character as memory operation.

@item -v
@cindex Option @code{-v}
@cindex @code{-v}
Enable verbose output.
More @code{-v} options increase verbosity level.

@item -V
@cindex Option @code{-V}
@cindex @code{-V}
Disable automatic verify check when writing data to the AVR with @code{-U}.

@item -x @var{extended_param}
@cindex Option @code{-x} @var{extended_param}
@cindex @code{-x} @var{extended_param}
Pass @var{extended_param} to the chosen programmer implementation as
an extended parameter.  The interpretation of the extended parameter
depends on the programmer itself.  See below for a list of programmers
accepting extended parameters or issue @code{avrdude -x help ...} to
see the extended options of the chosen programmer.

The `/RESET' signal will be left activated at program exit, that is it
will be held low, in order to keep the MCU in reset state afterwards.
Note in particular that the programming algorithm for the AT90S1200
device mandates that the `/RESET' signal is active before powering up
the MCU, so in case an external power supply is used for this MCU type,
a previous invocation of AVRDUDE with this option specified is one of
the possible ways to guarantee this condition. @code{flip2} will not

The `/RESET' line will be deactivated at program exit, thus allowing the

@table @code
@item vtarg=VALUE
Specify a voltage between 1.8 and 5.5@w{ }V that the programmer should supply
to the target. If there is already a valid voltage applied to the VTG Pin,
this setting will be ignored. When AVRDUDE detects an external voltage outside
of this range, it will terminate the operation. You can disable this check by
setting the voltage to 0@w{ }V. If an XMEGA part was selected, a requested voltage
above 3.49@w{ }V will lead to an abort of operation. 
@item hvupdi
High-voltage UPDI programming is used to enable a UPDI pin that has previously

@cindex Urboot bootloader
@cindex Urclock programmer
@cindex Urprotocol
@cindex Option @code{-x} Urclock
@cindex @code{-x} Urclock
@item Urclock

The urclock programmer type accepts the following extended parameters:
@table @code
@item showall
Show all info for the connected part, then exit. The @code{-x show...} options
below can be used to assemble a bespoke response consisting of a subset
(or only one item) of all available relevant information about the
connected part and bootloader.
@cindex @code{flash}
@cindex @code{eeprom}
@item showid
Show a unique Urclock ID stored in either flash or EEPROM of the MCU, then exit.
@item id=<E|F>.<addr>.<len>
Historically, the Urclock ID was a six-byte unique little-endian number
stored in Urclock boards at EEPROM address 257. The location of this
number can be set by the @code{-x id=<E|F>.<addr>.<len>} extended parameter. @code{E}
stands for EEPROM and @code{F} stands for flash. A negative address addr counts
from the end of EEPROM and flash, respectively. The length len of the
Urclock ID can be between 1 and 8 bytes.
@cindex @code{flash}
@item showdate
Show the last-modified date of the input file for the flash application,
then exit. If the input file was stdin, the date will be that of the
programming. Date and filename are part of the metadata that the urclock
programmer stores by default in high flash just under the bootloader; see also
@cindex @code{flash}
@code{-x nometadata}.
@item showfilename
Show the input filename (or title) of the last flash writing session, then exit.
@item title=<string>
When set, <string> will be used in lieu of the input filename. The maximum
string length for the title/filename field is 254 bytes including
terminating nul.
@item showapp
Show the size of the programmed application, then exit.
@cindex @code{flash}
@item showstore
Show the size of the unused flash between the application and metadata, then exit.
@item showmeta
Show the size of the metadata just below the bootloader, then exit.
@item showboot
Show the size of the bootloader, then exit.
@item showversion
Show bootloader version and capabilities, then exit.
@item showvector
Show the vector number and name of the interrupt table vector used by the
bootloader for starting the application, then exit. For hardware-supported
bootloaders this will be vector 0 (Reset), and for vector bootloaders this
will be any other vector number of the interrupt vector table or the slot
just behind the vector table with the name @code{VBL_ADDITIONAL_VECTOR}.
@item showpart
Show the part for which the bootloader was compiled, then exit.
@cindex @code{flash}
@item bootsize=<size>
Manual override for bootloader size. Urboot bootloaders put the number of
used bootloader pages into a table at the top of the bootloader section,
i.e., typically top of flash, so the urclock programmer can look up the
bootloader size itself. In backward-compatibility mode, when programming
via other bootloaders, this option can be used to tell the programmer the
size, and therefore the location, of the bootloader.
@cindex @code{flash}
@item vectornum=<n>
Manual override for vector number. Urboot bootloaders put the vector
number used by a vector bootloader into a table at the top of flash, so
this option is normally not needed for urboot bootloaders. However, it is
useful in backward-compatibility mode (or when the urboot bootloader does
not offer flash read). Specifying a vector number in these circumstances
implies a vector bootloader whilst the default assumption would be a
hardware-supported bootloader.
@cindex @code{eeprom}
@item eepromrw
Manual override for asserting EEPROM read/write capability. Not normally
needed for urboot bootloaders, but useful for in backward-compatibility
mode if the bootloader offers EEPROM read/write.
@cindex @code{flash}
@item emulate_ce
If an urboot bootloader does not offer a chip erase command it will tell
the urclock programmer so during handshake. In this case the urclock
programmer emulates a chip erase, if warranted by user command line
options, by filling the remainder of unused flash below the bootloader
with 0xff. If this option is specified, the urclock programmer will assume
that the bootloader cannot erase the chip itself. The option is useful
for backwards-compatible bootloaders that do not implement chip erase.
@cindex @code{flash}
@item restore
Write unchanged flash input files to the AVR and trim below the bootloader if
needed. This is most useful when one has a backup of the full flash and
wants to play that back onto the device. No metadata are written in this
case and no vector patching happens either if it is a vector bootloader.
However, for vector bootloaders, even under the option @code{-x restore} an
input file will not be written to the AVR for which the reset vector does not point
to the vector bootloader. This is to avoid loading an input file onto the
device that would render the vector bootloader becoming unreachable after reset.
@cindex @code{flash}
@item initstore
On writing to flash fill the store space between the flash application and
the metadata section with 0xff.
@cindex @code{flash}
@item nofilename
On writing to flash do not store the application input filename (nor a title).
@cindex @code{flash}
@item nodate
On writing to flash do not store the application input filename (nor a
title) and no date either.
@cindex @code{flash}
@item nostore
On writing to flash do not store metadata except the metadata code byte
@code{0xff} saying there are no metadata.  In particular, no data store
frame is programmed.
@cindex @code{flash}
@cindex Metadata
@item nometadata
Do not support any metadata. The full flash besides the bootloader is
available for the application. If the application is smaller than the
available space then a metadata code byte @code{0xff} is stored
nevertheless to indicate there are no further metadata available. In
absence of @code{-x nometadata}, the default for the urclock programmer is
to write as much metadata (filename, data and store information) as the
size of the application and the other extended options allow. The
subtle difference between @code{-x nometadata} and @code{-x nostore} is that
the latter always explicitly stores in flash that no further metadata are
available, so that a such prepared flash can always be queried with
@code{avrdude -x showall}. In contrast to this, it cannot be guaranteed
that a @code{-x showall} query on flash prepared with @code{-x nometadata}
yields useful results.
@item noautoreset
Do not toggle RTS/DTR lines on port open to prevent a hardware reset.
@item delay=<n>
Add a <n> ms delay after reset. This can be useful if a board takes a
particularly long time to exit from external reset. <n> can be negative,
in which case the default 120 ms delay after issuing reset will be
shortened accordingly.
@item strict
Urclock has a faster, but slightly different strategy than -c arduino to
synchronise with the bootloader; some stk500v1 bootloaders cannot cope
with this, and they need the @code{-x strict} option.
@end table

@cindex Option @code{-x} BusPirate
@cindex @code{-x} BusPirate
@cindex The Bus Pirate
@cindex BusPirate
@item BusPirate

The BusPirate programmer type accepts the following extended parameters:
@table @code
@item reset=cs,aux,aux2
The default setup assumes the BusPirate's CS output pin connected to
the RESET pin on AVR side. It is however possible to have multiple AVRs
connected to the same BP with SDI, SDO and SCK lines common for all of them.
In such a case one AVR should have its RESET connected to BusPirate's
@emph{CS}
pin, second AVR's RESET connected to BusPirate's
@emph{AUX}
pin and if your BusPirate has an
@emph{AUX2}
pin (only available on BusPirate version v1a with firmware 3.0 or newer)
use that to activate RESET on the third AVR.

It may be a good idea to decouple the BusPirate and the AVR's SPI buses from
each other using a 3-state bus buffer. For example 74HC125 or 74HC244 are some
good candidates with the latches driven by the appropriate reset pin (cs,
aux or aux2). Otherwise the SPI traffic in one active circuit may interfere
with programming the AVR in the other design.

@item spifreq=@var{0..7}

@item @code{5} @tab   2.6 MHz
@item @code{6} @tab   4 MHz
@item @code{7} @tab   8 MHz
@end multitable

@item rawfreq=0..3
Sets the SPI speed and uses the Bus Pirate's binary ``raw-wire'' mode instead
of the default binary SPI mode:

@multitable @columnfractions .05 .3
@item @code{0} @tab 5 kHz
@item @code{1} @tab 50 kHz
@item @code{2} @tab 100 kHz (Firmware v4.2+ only)
@item @code{3} @tab 400 kHz (v4.2+)
@end multitable

The only advantage of the ``raw-wire'' mode is that different SPI frequencies
are available. Paged writing is not implemented in this mode.

@item pullups
Enable the Bus Pirate's built-in pull-up resistors. These resistors are
useful when working with different voltage levels. VPU pin of the Bus Pirate
must be connected to an external voltage.
For example: connect VPU pin to the +5V pin or an external power supply.

@item hiz
Enable the Bus Pirate's HiZ mode on SPI, allowing it to work as an
open-collector and interface with external pull-up circuits.
If the external target circuit does not have pull-ups, the Bus Pirate
will not be able to send data.

@item ascii
Attempt to use ASCII mode even when the firmware supports BinMode (binary
mode).
BinMode is supported in firmware 2.7 and newer, older FW's either don't
have BinMode or their BinMode is buggy. ASCII mode is slower and makes
the above
@code{reset=}, @code{spifreq=}
and
@code{rawfreq=}
parameters unavailable. Be aware that ASCII mode is not guaranteed to work
with newer firmware versions, and is retained only to maintain compatibility
with older firmware versions.

@cindex @code{flash}
@item nopagedwrite
Firmware versions 5.10 and newer support a binary mode SPI command that enables
whole pages to be written to AVR flash memory at once, resulting in a
significant write speed increase. If use of this mode is not desirable for some
reason, this option disables it.

@item nopagedread
Newer firmware versions support in binary mode SPI command some AVR Extended
Commands. Using the ``Bulk Memory Read from Flash'' results in a
significant read speed increase. If use of this mode is not desirable for some
reason, this option disables it.

@item cpufreq=@var{125..4000}
This sets the @emph{AUX}  pin to output a frequency of @var{n} kHz. Connecting
the @emph{AUX} pin to the XTAL1 pin of your MCU, you can provide it a clock,
for example when it needs an external clock because of wrong fuses settings.
Make sure the CPU frequency is at least four times the SPI frequency.

@item serial_recv_timeout=@var{1...}
This sets the serial receive timeout to the given value.
The timeout happens every time avrdude waits for the BusPirate prompt.
Especially in ascii mode this happens very often, so setting a smaller value
can speed up programming a lot.
The default value is 100 ms. Using 10 ms might work in most cases.

@chapter Terminal Mode Operation
@cindex Terminal mode operation

AVRDUDE has an interactive mode called @var{terminal mode} that is
enabled by the @option{-t} option.  This mode allows one to enter
interactive commands to display and modify the various device memories,
perform a chip erase, display the device signature bytes and part
parameters, and to send raw programming commands.  Commands and
parameters may be abbreviated to their shortest unambiguous form.
Terminal mode also supports a command history so that previously entered
commands can be recalled and edited.

@menu
* Terminal Mode Commands::
* Terminal Mode Examples::
@end menu

@node Terminal Mode Commands, Terminal Mode Examples, Terminal Mode Operation, Terminal Mode Operation
@section Terminal Mode Commands
@cindex Terminal mode commands

In this mode, AVRDUDE only initializes communication with the MCU, and then
awaits user commands on standard input.  Commands and parameters may be
abbreviated to the shortest unambiguous form.  Terminal mode provides a
command history using readline(3), so previously entered command lines can be
recalled and edited.

The @var{addr} and @var{len} parameters of the dump, read, disasm, write,
save and erase commands can be negative with the same syntax as substring
computations in perl or python. The table below details their meaning with
respect to an example memory of size @code{sz=0x800} (2048 bytes).

@noindent
The following commands are implemented for all programmers:

@table @code

@item dump @var{memory} @var{addr} @var{len}
@cindex @code{dump} @var{[memory [addr [len]]]}
Read from the specified memory interval (see above), and display in the
usual hexadecimal and ASCII form.

@item dump @var{memory} @var{addr}
@cindex @code{dump} @var{[memory [addr [len]]]}
Read from memory addr as many bytes as the most recent dump memory addr
len command with this very memory had specified (default 256 bytes), and
display them.

@item dump @var{memory}
@cindex @code{dump} @var{[memory [addr [len]]]}
Continue dumping from the memory and location where the most recent dump
command left off; if no previous dump command has addressed a memory an
error message will be shown.

@item dump
@cindex @code{dump} @var{[memory [addr [len]]]}
Continue dumping from the memory and location where the most recent dump
command left off; if no previous dump command has addressed a memory an
error message will be shown.

@item dump @var{memory} @var{addr} @dots{}
@cindex @code{dump} @var{memory} @var{[addr]} @dots{} @w{ } @w{ } @w{ }
Start reading from @var{addr}, all the way to the last memory address
(deprecated: use @code{dump @var{memory} @var{addr} -1}).

@item dump @var{memory} @dots{}
@cindex @code{dump} @var{memory} @var{[addr]} @dots{} @w{ } @w{ } @w{ }
Read all bytes from the specified memory, and display them (deprecated:
use @code{dump @var{memory} 0 -1}).

@item read
@cindex @code{read} @var{[memory [addr [len]]]}
@cindex @code{read} @var{memory} @var{[addr]} @dots{} @w{ } @w{ } @w{ }
Can be used as an alias for dump.

@item disasm @var{[options]} @var{dump-arguments}
@cindex @code{disasm} @var{[memory [addr [len]]]}
Like dump, the disasm command displays a part of the specified memory,
albeit by interpreting the memory contents as AVR opcodes and showing it
as assembler source code. Unlike dump, the disasm command has options;
these control how disasm displays its result (see below). Other than that,
the syntax of specifying the memory and its to be processed interval is
virtually the same as that of dump: the default disasm length is 32 bytes,
though, and sometimes the length can be slightly shorter or longer than
requested, so that the memory section for disasm aligns with opcodes.
Disasm options, once set, stay in force until switched off, typically by
changing the case of the option. This way, a simple disasm without further
options can be used to step through memory keeping the appearance. Disasm
knows the following options:
@table @code

@item -g
Generate avr-gcc source: this sets @code{-sOFQ} and outputs a .text preamble and
a main symbol unless the disassembly emits one itself; @code{-G} (default)
switches off @code{-g} and stops outputting a preamble

@item -A
Do not show addresses; @code{-a} (the default) shows addresses

@item -O
Do not show opcode bytes; @code{-o} (the default) show opcode bytes

@item -C
Do not show comments; @code{-c} (the default) show comments

@item -f
Show affected flags in SREG, eg, @code{---SVNZC} for the @code{sbiw}
opcode; @code{-F} (the default) do not show SREG flags

@item -q
Show the number of machine cycles that an opcode takes; @code{-Q}
(the default) do not show the cycles

@item -n
Put the opcode full name into comment (eg, subtract immediate from word);
@code{-N} (the default) do not show the full opcode names

@item -e
Put a technical explanation of the opcode into the comment, eg,
@code{Rd+1:Rd <-- Rd+1:Rd - K} for the @code{sbiw} opcode; -E (the
default) do not show technical explanations

@item -S
Use AVR instruction set style: this means that register pairs are shown
as, eg, in r31:30 instead of r30; @code{-s} (the default) use avr-gcc code
style

@item -L
Do not preprocess labels; @code{-l} (the default) preprocess jump/call
labels

@item -d
Decode all opcodes including those that are undocumented; @code{-D} (the
default) decode only opcodes that are valid for the part

@item -z
Zap the list of jumps and calls before disassembly

@item -t=@var{file}
@cindex Tagfile
Delete symbols from a previously read tagfile, if any, and read the
tagfile @var{file} for assigning addresses to symbol names.
@end table

The tagfile is an ASCII file where each line describes a symbol for code
label addresses (@code{L}), variable addresses in flash (@code{P}) and
variables addresses in memory or I/O space (@code{M}). Hashmarks start a
tagfile comment that extends to the end of the line and is ignored by
disasm. Here is a defining example of how a tagfile looks like

@smallexample
@cartouche
0x7f54 L        putch     Outputs a char # L are code labels
0x7ffe P W 1    version16 A word integer # P are PGM data
0x7f80 P A 4    headings  Column headers # Auto-aligned strings
0x0100 M B 2048 sram      2 kB SRAM      # Memory address
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

Code labels @code{L} can be, eg, function names in program space or goto
labels.  They use up to four columns separated by white space: the
address, the letter @code{L}, the symbolic name of the label and an
optional comment column for the symbol, which is copied by disasm into the
disassembly comment column, should this label be referenced or used by the
code. Variable symbols have a @code{P} or @code{M} in the second column;
they can be bytes or words as determined by the letter @code{B} or
@code{W} in the third column and either single variables or arrays as
specified by the multiplicity count in the forth column. @code{P} symbols,
but not @code{M} symbols, can also be the base location of nul-terminated
strings as encoded by @code{A} or @code{S} in the third column. Out of
necessity, the space occupied by @code{A}/@code{S} strings varies. The
difference between @code{A} and @code{S} symbols is that the array of
@code{A} strings might have an additional nul character to auto-align the
space occupied by them to an even address. The fifth column is the
symbolic name for the @code{P} or @code{M} address that can be used by
disasm to output relevant addresses symbolically. @code{P} areas described
in the tagfile also tell disasm that the corresponding area is not code
and should not be disassembled as such; instead the directives are used
for disassembly of that area. As with @code{L} labels, @code{P} and
@code{M} variables may have an optional final comment column pertaining to
the symbol that may be output in the disassembly column as and when the
corresponding variables are used.

@cindex @code{flash}
Tagfiles are useful for disassembly to make the output of disasm more
readable. They can be built manually and incrementally as one's under‐
standing of the code grows. Alternatively, the bash shell script
@code{elf2tag} can automatically generate a tag file from the .elf file
that produced the flash contents:

@smallexample
@cartouche
$ elf2tag application.elf >application.tag
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@code{elf2tag} uses the @code{avr-objdump -d} disassembly to create
@code{L} labels and @code{avr-nm} to generate @code{M} symbols.

@item write @var{memory} @var{addr} @var{data[,]} @var{@{data[,]@}}
@cindex @code{write} @var{memory} @var{addr} @var{data[,]} @var{@{data[,]@}}
Manually program the respective memory cells, starting at address
@var{addr}, using the data items provided. The terminal implements reading
from and writing to flash, EEPROM, bootrow and usersig type memories normally
through a cache and paged access functions. All other memories are
directly written to without use of a cache. Some older parts without paged
access, depending on the programmer, might also have flash and EEPROM
directly accessed without cache.

Items @var{data} can have the following formats:

@multitable @columnfractions .25 .4 .25

@var{data}
can be binary, octal, decimal or hexadecimal integers, floating point
numbers or C-style strings and characters. If nothing matches, @code{data}
will be interpreted as a name of a file containing data, which will be
read and inserted at this point. In order to force the interpretation of a
data item as file, e.g., when the file name would be understood as a number
otherwise, the file name can be given a @code{:}@emph{f} format specifier.
In absence of a format suffix, the terminal will try to auto-detect
the file format.

For integers, an optional case-insensitive suffix specifies the data size
as in the table below:
@table @code
@item LL
8 bytes / 64 bits
@item L
4 bytes / 32 bits
@item H or S
2 bytes / 16 bits
@item HH
1 byte / 8 bits
@end table

Suffix @code{D} indicates a 64-bit double, @code{F} a 32-bit float, whilst a
floating point number without suffix defaults to 32-bit float. Hexadecimal
floating point notation is supported. An ambiguous trailing suffix, e.g.,
@code{0x1.8D}, is read as no-suffix float where @code{D} is part of the
mantissa; use a zero exponent @code{0x1.8p0D} to clarify.

An optional U suffix makes integers unsigned. Ordinary @code{0x}
hexadecimal and @code{0b} binary integers are always treated as unsigned.
@code{+0x}, @code{-0x}, @code{+0b} and @code{-0b} numbers with an explicit
sign are treated as signed unless they have a @code{U} suffix. Unsigned
integers cannot be larger than 2^64-1. If @var{n} is an unsigned integer
then @var{-n} is also a valid unsigned integer as in C. Signed integers
must fall into the [-2^63, 2^63-1] range or a correspondingly smaller
range when a suffix specifies a smaller type.

Ordinary @code{0x} hexadecimal and @code{0b} binary integers with @var{n}
hex digits (counting leading zeros) use the smallest size of one, two,
four and eight bytes that can accommodate any n-digit hexadecimal/binary
integer. If an integer suffix specifies a size explicitly the
corresponding number of least significant bytes are written, and a warning
shown if the number does not fit into the desired representation.
Otherwise, unsigned integers occupy the smallest of one, two, four or
eight bytes needed. Signed numbers are allowed to fit into the smallest
signed or smallest unsigned representation: For example, @code{255} is
stored as one byte as @code{255U} would fit in one byte, though as a
signed number it would not fit into a one-byte interval [-128, 127]. The
number @code{-1} is stored in one byte whilst @code{-1U} needs eight bytes
as it is the same as @code{0xFFFFffffFFFFffffU}.

One trailing comma at the end of data items is ignored to facilitate copy
and paste of lists.

@item write @var{memory} @var{addr} @var{data}
@cindex @code{write} @var{memory} @var{addr} @var{data}
The start address @code{addr} may be omitted if the size of the memory
being written to is one byte.

@item write @var{memory} @var{addr} @var{len} @var{data[,]} @var{@{data[,]@}} @dots{}
@cindex @code{write} @var{memory} @var{addr} @var{len} @var{data[,]} @var{@{data[,]@}} @dots{} @w{ }
The ellipsis @dots{} form writes the data to the entire memory intervall
addressed by @var{addr len} and, if necessary, pads the remaining space by
repeating the last data item. The fill write command does not write beyond
the specified memory area even if more data than needed were given.

@item save @var{memory} @var{@{addr len@}} @var{file[:format]}
@cindex @code{save} @var{memory} @var{@{addr len@}} @var{file[:format]}
Save one or more memory segments to a file in a format specified by the
@code{:}format letter. The default is @code{:r} for raw binary. Each
memory segment is described by an address and length pair. In absence of
any memory segments the entire memory is saved to the file. Only Motorola
S-Record (@code{:s}) and Intel Hex (@code{:i} or @code{:I}) formats store
address information with the saved data.  Avrdude cannot currently save
ELF file formats. All the other file formats lose the address information
and concatenate the chosen memory segments into the output file. If the
file name is - then avrdude writes to stdout.

@item backup @var{memlist} @var{file[:format]}
@cindex @code{backup} @var{memlist} @var{file[:format]}
Backup one or more memories to the specified file using the selected
format. The default format for a single-memory backup is @code{:r} (raw
binary); for multi-memory backups it is @code{:I} (Intel Hex with
comments). @var{Memlist} can be a comma separated list of memories just as
in the @code{-U} command line argument. @code{backup} flushes the cache
before reading memories.

@item restore @var{memlist} @var{file[:format]}
@cindex @code{restore} @var{memlist} @var{file[:format]}
Restore one or more memories from the specified file. It is the user's
responsibility to erase memories as needed beforehand: some paged memories
look like NOR-memory when using certain programmers, meaning programming
cannot set bits to 1 (eg, flash under most programmers). These memories
need to be erased beforehand using the erase command (see below). The
format only needs to be specified if it cannot be automatically detected,
eg, when the file is @code{-} for standard input. @var{Memlist} can be a
comma separated list of memories just as in the @code{-U} command line
argument. @code{restore} flushes the cache before writing memories and
resets the cache after writing memories. Note that restoring read-only
memories verifies file contents with the corresponding microprocessor's
memories.

@item verify @var{memlist} @var{file[:format]}
@cindex @code{verify} @var{memlist} @var{file[:format]}
Compare one or more memories with the specified file. Memlist can be a
comma separated list of memories just as in the @code{-U} command line
argument. @code{verify} flushes the cache before verifying memories.

@cindex @code{erase}
@cindex @code{flash}
@cindex @code{bootrow}
@cindex @code{eeprom}
@item erase
Perform a chip erase and discard all pending writes to flash, EEPROM and bootrow.
Note that EEPROM will be preserved if the EESAVE fuse bit is active, ie, had
a corresponding value at the last reset prior to the operation.

@item erase @var{memory}
@cindex @code{erase} @var{memory} @var{[addr len]}
Erase the entire specified memory.

@item erase @var{memory} @var{addr} @var{len}
@cindex @code{erase} @var{memory} @var{[addr len]}
Erase a section of the specified memory.

@item flush
@cindex @code{flush}
@cindex @code{usersig}
@cindex @code{bootrow}
@cindex @code{eeprom}
Synchronise with the device all pending writes to flash, EEPROM, bootrow and
usersig. With some programmer and part combinations, flash (and sometimes
EEPROM, too) looks like a NOR memory, i.e., a write can only clear bits,
never set them. For NOR memories a page erase or, if not available, a chip
erase needs to be issued before writing arbitrary data. Usersig is
unaffected by a chip erase. When a memory looks like a NOR
memory, either page erase is deployed (e.g., with parts that have PDI/UPDI
interfaces), or if that is not available, both EEPROM and flash caches are
fully read in, a chip erase command is issued and both EEPROM and flash
are written back to the device. Hence, it can take minutes to ensure that
a single previously cleared bit is set and, therefore, this routine should
be called sparingly.

@cindex @code{flush}
@cindex @code{usersig}
@cindex @code{bootrow}
@cindex @code{eeprom}
@cindex @code{abort}
@item abort
Normally, caches are only ever actually written to the device when using
@code{flush}, at the end of the terminal session after typing @code{quit},
or after EOF on input is encountered. The @code{abort} command resets the
cache discarding all previous writes to the flash, EEPROM, bootrow and
usersig cache.

@item config @var{[opts]}
@cindex @code{config} @var{[opts]}
Show all configuration properties of the part; these are usually bitfields
in fuses or lock bits bytes that can take on values, which typically have
a mnemonic name. Each part has their own set of configurable items.  The
option @code{-f} groups the configuration properties by the fuses and lock
bits byte they are housed in, and shows the current value of these
memories as well. Config @code{-a} outputs an initialisation script with
all properties and all possible respective assignments. The currently
assigned mnemonic values are the ones that are not commented out. The
option @code{-v} increases the verbosity of the output of the config
command.

@item config @var{[opts]} @var{property} @var{[opts]}
@cindex @code{config} @var{[opts]} @var{property} @var{[opts]}
Show the current value of the named configuration property. Wildcards or
initial strings are permitted (but not both), in which case the current
values of all matching properties are displayed.

@item config @var{[opts]} @var{property=} @var{[opts]}
@cindex @code{config} @var{[opts]} @var{property=} @var{[opts]}
Show all possible values of the named configuration property (notice the
trailing @code{=}). The one that is currently set is the only one not
commented out. As before, wildcards or initial strings are permitted.

@item config @var{[opts]} @var{property=value} @var{[opts]}
@cindex @code{config} @var{[opts]} @var{property=value} @var{[opts]}
Modify the named configuration property to the given value. The
corresponding fuse or lock bits will be changed immediately but the change
will normally only take effect the next time the part is reset, at which
point the fuses and lock bits are utilised. Value can either be a valid
integer or one of the symbolic mnemonics, if known. Wildcards or initial
strings are permitted for either the property or the assigned mnemonic
value, but an assignment only happens if both the property and the name
can be uniquely resolved.

It is quite possible, as is with direct writing to the underlying fuses
and lock bits, to brick a part, i.e., make it unresponsive to further
programming with the chosen programmer: here be dragons.

@cindex @code{eeprom}
@cindex @code{factory reset}
@item factory reset
Resets the connected part to factory state as far as possible
(bootloaders, for example, cannot write fuses and may not have a means to
erase EEPROM). This command may change the clock frequency F_CPU of the
part after the next MCU reset when the changed fuse values come into
effect. As such, this may require that future avrdude calls use a
different bit clock rate up to F_CPU/4 for the programmer next time. Note
that the command @code{factory} can be abbreviated but the required
argument @code{reset} needs to be spelled out in full.

@item regfile @var{[opts]}
@cindex @code{regfile} @var{[opts]}
@code{regfile} with no further argument displays the register file of a
part, i.e., all register names and their contents in  @code{io} memory, if
possible: note that external programming cannot read the registers of
classic parts (ISP or TPI interfaces).

Option @code{-a} displays the register I/O addresses in addition;
@code{-m} displays the register memory addresses used for
@code{lds}/@code{sts} opcodes instead of the I/O addresses. Option
@code{-s} also shows the size of the register in bytes whilst @code{-v}
shows a slightly expanded register explanation alongside each register.

@item regfile @var{[opts]} @var{reg} @var{[opts]}
@cindex @code{regfile} @var{[opts]} @var{reg} @var{[opts]}
@code{regfile} together with a register name @var{reg} shows all those
registers that are matched by @var{reg}. Wildcards or partial strings are
permitted but not both. Register names have the form @var{module.name} or
@var{module.instance.name}. If the provided @var{reg} is a full, existing
register name, e.g., @code{porta.out} then that is the only register that
is displayed even though that might be a partial name of another register,
eg, @code{porta.outdir}. If the provided @var{reg} is the same as
@var{instance.name} or @var{name} then partial matching is no longer
utilised and all module registers with that exact @var{instance.name} or
@var{name} are shown. Partial matching can be forced through use of
wildcards, e.g., using @code{porta.out*}

@item regfile @var{[opts]} @var{reg}=@var{value} @var{[opts]}
@cindex @code{regfile} @var{[opts]} @var{reg}=@var{value} @var{[opts]}
This sets a single register addressed by @var{reg} to the given
@var{value}. Only external programming of modern parts (those with UPDI
interface) can read from and write to register io memory, but as that
memory is volatile, the contents will be lost after reset.

@item include @var{[opts]} @var{file}
@cindex @code{include} @var{[opts]} @var{file}
Include contents of the named file @var{file} as if it was typed. This is
useful for batch scripts, e.g., recurring initialisation code for fuses. The
include option @code{-e} prints the lines of the file as comments before
processing them; on a non-zero verbosity level the line numbers are
printed, too.

@item signature
@cindex @code{signature}
Display the device signature bytes.

@item part @var{[opts]}
@cindex @code{part} @var{[opts]}
@cindex Programming mode
@cindex Variants of parts
Display the current part information, including supported programming modes,
memory and variants tables. Use @var{-m} to only print the memory table,
and @var{-v} to only print the variants table.

@item verbose @var{]level]}
@cindex @code{verbose} @var{]level]}
Change (when @var{level} is provided), or display the verbosity
level.
The initial verbosity level is controlled by the number of @code{-v} options
given on the command line.

@item quell @var{[level]}
@cindex @code{quell} @var{[level]}
Change (when @var{level} is provided), or display the quell
level. 1 is used to suppress progress reports. 2 or higher yields
progressively quieter operations. The initial quell level is controlled
by the number of @code{-q} options given on the command line.

@item ?
@itemx help
Give a short on-line summary of the available commands.

@item quit
@cindex @code{quit}
Leave terminal mode and thus AVRDUDE.

@item q
Can be used as an alias for @code{quit}.

@item !@var{line}
@cindex @code{!} (subshell)
Run the shell @var{line} in a subshell, e.g., @code{!ls *.hex}. Subshell
commands take the rest of the line as their command. For security reasons,
they must  be enabled explictly by putting @code{allow_subshells = yes;}
into your @code{$@{HOME@}/.config/avrdude/avrdude.rc} or
@code{$@{HOME@}/.avrduderc} file.

@item # @var{comment}
Place comments onto the terminal line (useful for scripts).

@end table

@noindent
In addition, the following commands are supported on some programmers:

@table @code

@item pgerase @var{memory} @var{addr}
@cindex @code{pgerase} @var{memory} @var{addr}
Erase one page of the memory specified.

@item send @var{b1} @var{b2} @var{b3} @var{b4}
@cindex @code{send} @var{b1} @var{b2} @var{b3} @var{b4}
Send raw instruction codes to the AVR device. If you need access to a
feature of an AVR part that is not directly supported by AVRDUDE, this
command allows you to use it, even though AVRDUDE does not implement the
command. When using direct SPI mode, up to 3 bytes
can be omitted.

@item spi
@cindex @code{spi}
Enter direct SPI mode.  The @emph{pgmled} pin acts as chip select.
@emph{Only supported on parallel bitbang programmers, and partially by USBtiny.}
Chip Select must be externally held low for direct SPI when
using USBtinyISP, and send must be a multiple of four bytes.

@item pgm
@cindex @code{pgm}
Return to programming mode (from direct SPI mode).

@item vtarg @var{voltage}
@cindex @code{vtarg} @var{voltage}
Set the target's supply voltage to @var{voltage} Volts.

@item varef @var{[channel]} @var{voltage}
@cindex @code{varef} @var{[channel]} @var{voltage}
Set the adjustable voltage source to @var{voltage} Volts.
This voltage is normally used to drive the target's
@emph{Aref} input on the STK500 and STK600.
The STK600 offers two reference voltages, which can be
selected by the optional parameter @var{channel} (either
0 or 1).

@item fosc @var{freq}[@code{M}|@code{k}]
@cindex @code{fosc} @var{freq}[@code{M}|@code{k}]
Set the programming oscillator to @var{freq} Hz.
An optional trailing letter @code{M}
multiplies by 1E6, a trailing letter @code{k} by 1E3.

@item fosc off
@cindex @code{fosc off}
Turn the programming oscillator off.

@item sck @var{period}
@cindex @code{sck} @var{period}
Set the SCK clock period to @var{period} microseconds.
Note that some official Microchip programmers store the bitclock setting and
will continue to use it until a diferent value is provided. See
@code{-B bitclock} for more information.

@item parms
@cindex @code{parms}
Display programmer specific parameters.

@chapter Configuration Files


@noindent
AVRDUDE reads a configuration file upon startup which describes all of
the parts and programmers that it knows about.  The advantage of this is
that if you have a chip that is not currently supported by AVRDUDE, you
can add it to the configuration file without waiting for a new release
of AVRDUDE. Likewise, if you have a parallel port programmer that is
not supported, chances are that you can copy an
existing programmer definition and, with only a few changes, make your
programmer work.

AVRDUDE first looks for a system wide configuration file in a platform
dependent location.  On Unix, this is usually
@code{/usr/local/etc/avrdude.conf}@xref{Unix}, whilst on Windows it is usually in the
same location as the executable file.  The full name of this file can be
specified using the @option{-C} command line option.  After parsing the system wide
configuration file, AVRDUDE looks for a per-user configuration
file to augment or override the system wide defaults.  On Unix, the
per-user file is @code{$@{XDG_CONFIG_HOME@}/avrdude/avrdude.rc}, whereas
if @code{$@{XDG_CONFIG_HOME@}} is either not set or empty,
@code{$@{HOME@}/.config/} is used instead. If that does not exist
@code{.avrduderc} within the user's home directory is used. On Windows,
this file is the @code{avrdude.rc} file located in the same directory as
the executable.

rare case @code{avrdude -t} is set up with attached hardware to provide a
web service, remote ssh or a login on a PC instead of a shell, say, for
demo or training purposes. In almost all other cases this can be
overridden in the per-user @code{avrddude.rc} or @code{.avrduderc}
configuration file with @var{yes}.

@noindent
The format of a serial adapter definition is as follows:

@smallexample
serialadapter
    parent <id>                               # optional serialadapter or programmer parent
    id       = <id1> [, <id2> ... ];          # <idN> are quoted strings
    desc     = <description>;                 # quoted string
    baudrate = <num>;                         # optional default baudrate, eg, in .avrduderc
    usbvid   = <hexnum>;                      # USB vendor ID
    usbpid   = <hexnum> [, <hexnum> ...];     # list of USB product IDs
    usbsn    = <serialno>;                    # USB Serial Number in per-user .avrduderc
;
@end smallexample

Technically, a @code{serialadapter} is implemented as @code{programmer}
that has only USB parameters defined. It can be used for a @code{-P
<serialadapter>[:<serial number>]} port specification instead of the
created serial port. Per-user serialadapter definitions in
@code{~/.avrduderc} or @code{avrdude.rc} files can add a serial number to
assign a particular board a specific id and default communication baud rate:

@smallexample
serialadapter parent "ft232r"
    id                     = "bike-shed-door";
    usbsn                  = "0123456789";
    baudrate               = 250000;
;
@end smallexample

@noindent
This is particularly useful for programming through a bootloader as it
allows specifying the port as @code{-P bike-shed-door} rather than having
to figure out which serial port name the operating system has assigned to
the plugged in bike-shed-door board at runtime. Note that each programmer
that defines @code{usbpid} and sets @code{is_serialadapter = yes} can also
be utilised as a serialadapter.

If any of the above parameters are not specified, the default value of 0
is used for numerics (except for @code{mcuid}, @code{hvupdi_variant},
@code{ocdrev}, @code{initval} and @code{bitmask}, all of which default to
-1, and for @code{autobaud_sync} which defaults to 0x30) or the empty
string @code{""} for string values. If a required parameter is left empty,
AVRDUDE will complain. Almost all occurrences of numbers (with the
exception of pin numbers and where they are separated by space, e.g., in
signature and readback) can also be given as simple expressions involving
arithemtic and bitwise operators.

@noindent
Parts can also inherit parameters from previously defined parts using
the following syntax. In this case specified integer and string values
override parameter values from the parent part. New  memory definitions
are added to the definitions inherited from the  parent. If, however, a
new memory definition refers to an existing one of the same name for
that part then, from v7.1, the existing memory definition is extended,
and components overwritten with new values. Assigning @code{NULL}
removes an inherited SPI instruction format, memory definition, control
stack, eeprom or flash instruction, e.g., as in @code{memory "efuse" =
NULL;}. The @code{variants} parameter is never inherited as it almost
always would be a mistake to do so: @code{variants} defines a string
list detailing variant names of the  part followed by an optional
colon, the package code and some absolute maximum ratings.

@noindent
Example format for part inheritance:

@smallexample
   part parent <id>                              # String identifying parent
       id               = <id>;                  # Id string for new part
       <any set of other parameters from the list above>
   ;

@subsection Instruction Format
@cindex Instruction format

@noindent
Instruction formats are specified as a comma separated list of string
values containing information (bit specifiers) about each of the 32 bits
of the instruction.  Bit specifiers may be one of the following formats:

@table @code

@item 1
The bit is always set on input as well as output

@item 0
The bit is always clear on input as well as output

@item x
The bit is ignored on input and output

@item a
The bit is an address bit, the bit-number matches this bit specifier's
position within the current instruction byte

@item a@var{N}
The bit is the @var{N}th address bit, bit-number = N, i.e., @code{a12}
is address bit 12 on input, @code{a0} is address bit 0.

@item i
The bit is an input data bit; as with @code{a} bits an input data bit can
optionally be followed by a bit number, here between 0 and 7, if the bit
needs to be moved to a different position in the SPI write command byte
than it appears in memory.

@item o
The bit is an output data bit; as with @code{i} bits an output data bit
can optionally be followed by a bit number; this is useful in case the
part's SPI read command places a particular bit into a different position
than the write command put it, e.g., ATtiny22L or AT90S8535 lock bits.

@end table

Each instruction must be composed of 32 bit specifiers.  The instruction
specification closely follows the instruction data provided in Atmel's
data sheets for their parts.  For example, the EEPROM read and write
instruction for an AT90S2313 AVR part could be encoded as:

@smallexample

read  = "1  0  1  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x",
        "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   o o o o  o o o o";

write = "1  1  0  0   0  0  0  0   x x x x  x x x x",
        "x a6 a5 a4  a3 a2 a1 a0   i i i i  i i i i";

@end smallexample

As the address bit numbers in the SPI opcodes are highly systematic, they
don't really need to be specified. A compact version of the format
specification neither uses bit-numbers for address lines nor spaces. If such
a string is longer than 7 characters, then the characters @code{0}, @code{1},
@code{x}, @code{a}, @code{i} and @code{o} will be recognised as the
corresponding bit, whilst any of the characters @code{.}, @code{-}, @code{_}
or @code{/} can act as arbitrary visual separators, which are ignored.
Examples:

@smallexample

  loadpage_lo = "0100.0000--000x.xxxx--xxaa.aaaa--iiii.iiii";

  loadpage_lo = "0100.0000", "000x.xxxx", "xxaa.aaaa", "iiii.iiii";

@item
The @code{stk500_devcode} parameter is the device code used by the STK500
and is obtained from the software section (@code{avr061.zip}) of
Atmel's AVR061 application note available from
@url{http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2525.pdf}.

@item
Not all memories will implement all instructions.

@item
AVR Fuse bits and Lock bits are implemented as a type of memory.

@item
Example memories are: @code{flash}, @code{eeprom}, @code{fuse},
@code{lfuse} (low fuse), @code{hfuse} (high fuse), @code{efuse}
(extended fuse), @code{signature}, @code{calibration}, @code{lock}.

@item
The memory specified on the AVRDUDE command line must match one of
the memories defined for the specified chip.

@item
The @code{pwroff_after_write} flag causes AVRDUDE to attempt to power
the device off and back on after an unsuccessful write to the affected
memory area if VCC programmer pins are defined.  If VCC pins are not
defined for the programmer, a message indicating that the device needs a
power-cycle is printed out.  This flag was added to work around a
problem with the at90s4433/2333's; see the at90s4433 errata at:

         @url{https://www.microchip.com/content/dam/mchp/documents/OTH/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/doc1042.pdf}

@item
The boot loader from application note AVR109 (and thus also the AVR
Butterfly) does not support writing of fuse bits.  Writing lock bits
is supported, but is restricted to the boot lock bits (BLBxx).  These
are restrictions imposed by the underlying SPM instruction that is used
to program the device from inside the boot loader.  Note that programming
the boot lock bits can result in a ``shoot-into-your-foot'' scenario as
the only way to unprogram these bits is a chip erase, which will also
erase the boot loader code.

@cindex @code{flash}
The boot loader implements the ``chip erase'' function by erasing the
flash pages of the application section.

Reading fuse and lock bits is fully supported.

Ensure the correct socket and routing card are mounted @emph{before}
powering on the STK600.  While the STK600 firmware ensures the socket
and routing card mounted match each other (using a table stored
internally in nonvolatile memory), it cannot handle the case where a
wrong routing card is used, e. g. the routing card
@code{STK600-RC040M-5} (which is meant for 40-pin DIP AVRs that have
an ADC, with the power supply pins in the center of the package) was
used but an ATmega8515 inserted (which uses the ``industry standard''
pinout with Vcc and GND at opposite corners).

Note that for devices that use the routing card @code{STK600-RC008T-2},
in order to use ISP mode, the jumper for @code{AREF0} must be removed
as it would otherwise block one of the ISP signals.  High-voltage
serial programming can be used even with that jumper installed.

The ISP system of the STK600 contains a detection against shortcuts
and other wiring errors.  AVRDUDE initiates a connection check before
trying to enter ISP programming mode, and display the result if the
target is not found ready to be ISP programmed.

High-voltage programming requires the target voltage to be set to at
least 4.5 V in order to work.  This can be done using
@emph{Terminal Mode}, see @ref{Terminal Mode Operation}.

@cindex DFU Bootloader using FLIP version 1

Bootloaders using the FLIP protocol version 1 experience some very
specific behaviour.

These bootloaders have no option to access memory areas other than
Flash and EEPROM.

@cindex @code{flash}
When the bootloader is started, it enters a @emph{security mode} where
the only acceptable access is to query the device configuration
parameters (which are used for the signature on AVR devices).  The
only way to leave this mode is a @emph{chip erase}.  As a chip erase
is normally implied by the @option{-U} option when reprogramming the
flash, this peculiarity might not be very obvious immediately.

Sometimes, a bootloader with security mode already disabled seems to
no longer respond with sensible configuration data, but only 0xFF for
all queries.  As these queries are used to obtain the equivalent of a
signature, AVRDUDE can only continue in that situation by forcing the
signature check to be overridden with the @option{-F} option.

@cindex @code{eeprom}
A @emph{chip erase} might leave the EEPROM unerased, at least on some
versions of the bootloader.

SerialUPDI programmer can be used for programming UPDI-only devices
using very simple serial connection.
You can read more about the details here
@url{https://github.com/SpenceKonde/AVR-Guidance/blob/master/UPDI/jtag2updi.md}

SerialUPDI programmer has been tested using FT232RL USB->UART interface
with the following connection layout (copied from Spence Kohde's page linked
above):

@noindent
@example
------------------                              To Target device
              DTR|                               _______________
              Rx |-----------,------------------| UPDI---\/\/------->
Tx---/\/\/\---Tx |----|<|---'          .--------| Gnd    470 ohm
  resistor    Vcc|------------------------------| Vcc
      1k      CTS|                  .`          |_______________
              Gnd|-----------------'
------------------
@end example

There are several limitations in current SerialUPDI/AVRDUDE integration,
listed below.

Currently available devices support only UPDI NVM programming model 0, 2
3 and 5, but there is also experimental implementation of model 4 - it
has been tested only on a single device, so issues with other devices are
expected. Full NVM v4 mode support will be provided once the hardware is
widely available.

@cindex @code{signature}
One of the core AVRDUDE features is verification of the connection by
reading device signature prior to any operation, but this operation
is not possible on UPDI locked devices. Therefore, to be able to
connect to such a device, you have to provide @option{-F} to override
this check.

Please note: using @option{-F} during write operation to locked device
will force chip erase. Use carefully.

@cindex @code{eeprom}
Another issue you might notice is slow performance of EEPROM writing
using SerialUPDI for AVR Dx devices. This can be addressed by changing
@emph{avrdude.conf} section for this device - changing EEPROM page
size to 0x20 (instead of default 1), like so:

@example
#------------------------------------------------------------
# AVR128DB28
#------------------------------------------------------------

part parent    ".avrdx"
    id        = "avr128db28";
    desc      = "AVR128DB28";
    signature = 0x1E 0x97 0x0E;

    memory "flash"
        size      = 0x20000;
        offset    = 0x800000;
        page_size = 0x200;
        readsize  = 0x100;
    ;

    memory "eeprom"
        size      = 0x200;
        offset    = 0x1400;
        page_size = 0x20;
        readsize  = 0x100;
    ;
;
@end example

The point of USERROW is to  provide ability to write configuration details
to already locked device and currently SerialUPDI interface supports this
feature. Please note: on locked devices it's not possible to read back
USERROW contents when written, so the automatic verification will most
likely fail and to prevent error messages, use @option{-V}.

In case you run into issues with the SerialUPDI interface, please
make sure to run the intended command with debug output enabled
(@option{-v -v -v}) and provide this verbose output with your
bug report. You can also try to perform the same action using
@emph{pymcuprog} (@url{https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-tools/pymcuprog})
utility with @option{-v debug} and provide its output too.
You will notice that both outputs are pretty similar, and this
was implemented like that on purpose - it was supposed to make
analysis of UPDI protocol quirks easier.

@cindex LED management

Some hardware programmers have LEDs, and the firmware controls them fully
without AVRDUDE having a way to influence their LED states. Other
programmers have LEDs and expect the host downloader/uploader to handle
them, for example bit-banging programmers, ftdi-based programmers or
linuxgpio programmers. For those programmers AVRDUDE provides support of
four LEDs (RDY, ERR, PGM and VFY) which can be set via corresponding
subroutines in the code for the respective @code{-c} programmer.

The RDY LED is set once the programmer is initialised and switched off
when AVRDUDE exits. During reading, writing or erasing the target the PGM
LED flashes with around 2.5 Hz, whilst the VFY LED comes on during -U
verification of the written contents. Errors are indicated with the ERR
LED.

Assuming AVRDUDE got to the point where LEDs are accessible and the RDY
LED was switched on then, on exit, AVRDUDE will leave the LEDs in the
following states:

In most cases the kernel driver initializes a plug-and-play device to be
owned by user @code{root} and group @code{root} with only r/w permission
for the user @code{root} rendering the device inaccessible to regular
users. Whilst users can run AVRDUDE sessions as root this is definitely
@emph{not good practice}. Giving USB plug-and-play devices the correct
permissions is much better. USB AVR programmers are normally identified by
a two-byte hexadecimal vendor ID and a two-byte hexadecimal product id.
Both are typically used to identify the device that needs new permissions.

In FreeBSD a so-called @code{devd} config files in
@code{/usr/local/etc/devd} serve to modify permissions of plugged-in USB
devices. Here is an example how Atmel's JTAGICE3 programmer (product ID
0x2110 or 0x2140) by Atmel (vendor ID 0x0eb) can be given appropriate
permissions using a file @code{jtagice3.conf}:

@smallexample
@cartouche
notify 100 @{

  match "subsystem" "DEVICE";
  match "type" "ATTACH";
  match "vendor" "0x03eb";

  action "chmod 660 /dev/$cdev";
  action "chgrp yourgroup /dev/$cdev";
@};
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent @code{yourgroup} would be a group that the user(s) should be
member of who wish to have access to the programmer.

Linux has a special userspace @code{/dev} device manager called udev that
deals with, amongst other things, plug-and-play USB devices. It is
recommended to specify so-called udev rules to define access permissions
for these devices instead. These rules typically reside in a file with the
name @var{nn}@code{-}@var{descriptive-name}@code{.rules} in the directory
@code{/etc/udev/rules.d}. Here, @var{nn} is a two-digit number that
determines the lexical order in which the udev rule files are processed.
Rules processed later can overwrite earlier rules, but it not recommended
to put user-generated rules higher than 60, as some of the actions they
require are processed by higher-level system rules.

Here a typical udev rule for allowing an ordinary user access to the
plugged-in AVRISP mkII programmer (product ID 0x2104) by Atmel (vendor ID
0x0eb):

@smallexample
@cartouche
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS@{idVendor@}=="03eb", ATTRS@{idProduct@}=="2104", \
  MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@noindent This furnishes the corresponding device node with @code{0660}
access permissions: this means r/w for the user @code{root} and any user
belonging to the group of the device, which the device driver might assign
to a different group than the default @code{root}. The key of the rule is
the attached @code{TAG} named @code{uaccess}, which has the effect that
the login daemon applies a dynamic user access control list to the device
node making the device usable for the currently logged-in user. When used
in anger, udev rules must appear on one line; above example was broken
into two lines so it fits into the example box.

AVRDUDE's developer option @code{-c }@var{programmer}@code{/u} will show
above suggested udev rule for the named programmer. Wildcards are allowed:

@smallexample
@cartouche
$ avrdude -c jtag\*/u

1. Examine the suggested udev rules below; to install run:

avrdude -c "jtag*/u" | tail -n +11 | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/55-avrdude-jtagX.rules
sudo chmod 0644 /etc/udev/rules.d/55-avrdude-jtagX.rules

2. Unplug any AVRDUDE USB programmers and plug them in again
3. Enjoy user access to the USB programmer(s)

Note: To install all udev rules known to AVRDUDE follow: avrdude -c "*/u" | more

@noindent Again, each rule must be written as one line: breaking up rules

Please report any bugs encountered via

AVRDUDE's wiki @url{https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude/wiki} is a great
place to learn about installing AVRDUDE on various platforms and,
generally, to learn a few tricks of the trade. In paticular, the
@url{https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude/wiki/FAQ, FAQ} and the
@url{https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude/wiki/Known-limitations-of-avrdude,
known limitations} of avrdude are worth reading.

Here a few examples for things that can go wrong and what to do:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Problem: I'm using a serial programmer under Windows and get the following
error:

@code{avrdude: serial_open(): can't set attributes for device "com1"},

Solution: This problem seems to appear with certain versions of Cygwin. Specifying
@code{"/dev/com1"} instead of @code{"com1"} should help.


@item
Problem: I'm using Linux and my AVR910 programmer is really slow.

Solution (short): @code{setserial @var{port} low_latency}

Solution (long):
There are two problems here. First, the system may wait some time before it
passes data from the serial port to the program. Under Linux the following
command works around this (you may need root privileges for this).

@code{setserial @var{port} low_latency}

Secondly, the serial interface chip may delay the interrupt for some time.
This behaviour can be changed by setting the FIFO-threshold to one. Under Linux this
can only be done by changing the kernel source in @code{drivers/char/serial.c}.
Search the file for @code{UART_FCR_TRIGGER_8} and replace it with @code{UART_FCR_TRIGGER_1}. Note that overall performance might suffer if there
is high throughput on serial lines. Also note that you are modifying the kernel at
your own risk.


@item
Problem: I'm not using Linux and my AVR910 programmer is really slow.

Solutions: The reasons for this are the same as above.
If you know how to work around this on your OS, please let us know.

@cindex @code{eeprom}
@item
Problem: Page-mode programming the EEPROM (using the -U option) does
not erase EEPROM cells before writing, and thus cannot necessarily overwrite
previous values that are different to 0xff.

Solution: None.  This is an inherent feature of the way JTAG EEPROM
programming works, and is documented that way in the Atmel AVR
datasheets.
In order to successfully program the EEPROM that way, a prior chip
erase (with the EESAVE fuse unprogrammed) is required.
This also applies to the STK500 and STK600 in high-voltage programming mode.

Programming the EEPROM in the terminal, however, will recognise that the
programmer struggles to write to EEPROM and read the flash, EEPROM and, if
present, bootrow contents, perform a chip erase and then write the
memories back. This happens when flushing the cache or leaving the
terminal and, out of necessity, take some time.

@item
Problem: How do I turn off the @var{DWEN} fuse?

Solution: If the @var{DWEN} (debugWIRE enable) fuse is activated,
the @var{/RESET} pin is not functional anymore, so normal ISP
communication cannot be established.
There are two options to deactivate that fuse again: high-voltage
programming, or getting the JTAG ICE mkII talk debugWIRE, and
prepare the target AVR to accept normal ISP communication again.

The first option requires a programmer that is capable of high-voltage
programming (either serial or parallel, depending on the AVR device),
for example the STK500.  In high-voltage programming mode, the
@var{/RESET} pin is activated initially using a 12 V pulse (thus the
name @emph{high voltage}), so the target AVR can subsequently be
reprogrammed, and the @var{DWEN} fuse can be cleared.  Typically, this
operation cannot be performed while the AVR is located in the target
circuit though.

The second option requires a JTAG ICE mkII that can talk the debugWIRE
protocol.  The ICE needs to be connected to the target using the
JTAG-to-ISP adapter, so the JTAG ICE mkII can be used as a debugWIRE
initiator as well as an ISP programmer.  AVRDUDE will then be activated
using the @var{jtag2isp} programmer type.  The initial ISP
communication attempt will fail, but AVRDUDE then tries to initiate a
debugWIRE reset.  When successful, this will leave the target AVR in a
state where it can accept standard ISP communication.  The ICE is then
signed off (which will make it signing off from the USB as well), so
AVRDUDE has to be called again afterwards.  This time, standard ISP
communication can work, so the @var{DWEN} fuse can be cleared.

The pin mapping for the JTAG-to-ISP adapter is:

Problem: Multiple USBasp or USBtinyISP programmers connected simultaneously are not
found.

Solution: The USBtinyISP code supports distinguishing multiple
programmers based on their bus:device connection tuple that describes
their place in the USB hierarchy on a specific host.  This tuple can
be added to the @var{-P usb} option, similar to adding a serial number
on other USB-based programmers.

The actual naming convention for the bus and device names is
operating-system dependent; AVRDUDE will print out what it found
on the bus when running it with (at least) one @var{-v} option.
By specifying a string that cannot match any existing device
(for example, @var{-P usb:xxx}), the scan will list all possible
candidate devices found on the bus.

Examples:
@example
avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega8 -P usb:003:025 (Linux)
avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega8 -P usb:/dev/usb:/dev/ugen1.3 (FreeBSD 8+)
avrdude -c usbtiny -p atmega8 \
  -P usb:bus-0:\\.\libusb0-0001--0x1781-0x0c9f (Windows)
@end example

For USBasp, the same format for @var{-P usb} can be used to match usb bus/device. Alternatively,
device serial number can be specified as follows (for serial number '1234').

@example
avrdude -c USBasp -p atmega8 -P usb:1234
@end example


@item
Problem: I cannot do @dots{} when the target is in debugWIRE mode.

Solution: debugWIRE mode imposes several limitations.

The debugWIRE protocol is Atmel's proprietary one-wire (plus ground)
protocol to allow an in-circuit emulation of the smaller AVR devices,
using the @var{/RESET} line.
DebugWIRE mode is initiated by activating the @var{DWEN}
fuse, and then power-cycling the target.
While this mode is mainly intended for debugging/emulation, it
also offers limited programming capabilities.
Effectively, the only memory areas that can be read or programmed
in this mode are flash and EEPROM.
It is also possible to read out the signature.
All other memory areas cannot be accessed.
There is no
@emph{chip erase}
functionality in debugWIRE mode; instead, while reprogramming the
flash, each flash page is erased right before updating it.
This is done transparently by the JTAG ICE mkII (or AVR Dragon).
The only way back from debugWIRE mode is to initiate a special
sequence of commands to the JTAG ICE mkII (or AVR Dragon), so the
debugWIRE mode will be temporarily disabled, and the target can
be accessed using normal ISP programming.
This sequence is automatically initiated by using the JTAG ICE mkII
or AVR Dragon in ISP mode, when they detect that ISP mode cannot be
entered.

Problem: I want to use my JTAG ICE mkII to program an
Xmega device through PDI.  The documentation tells me to use the
@emph{XMEGA PDI adapter for JTAGICE mkII} that is supposed to ship
with the kit, yet I don't have it.

Solution: Use the following pin mapping:

Problem: I want to use my AVRISP mkII to program an

@item
Problem: I want to program an ATtiny4/5/9/10 device using a serial/parallel
bitbang programmer.  How to connect the pins?

Solution: Since TPI has only 1 pin for bi-directional data transfer, both
@var{SDI} and @var{SDO} pins should be connected to the @var{TPIDATA} pin
on the ATtiny device.
However, a 1K resistor should be placed between the @var{SDO} and @var{TPIDATA}.
The @var{SDI} pin connects to @var{TPIDATA} directly.
The @var{SCK} pin is connected to @var{TPICLK}.

In addition, the @var{Vcc}, @var{/RESET} and @var{GND} pins should
be connected to their respective ports on the ATtiny device.

@item
Problem: How can I use a FTDI FT232R USB-to-Serial device for bitbang programming?

Solution: When connecting the FT232 directly to the pins of the target Atmel device,
the polarity of the pins defined in the @code{programmer} definition should be
inverted by prefixing a tilde. For example, the @var{dasa} programmer would
look like this when connected via a FT232R device (notice the tildes in
front of pins 7, 4, 3 and 8):

@example
programmer
  id    = "dasa_ftdi";
  desc  = "serial port banging, reset=rts sck=dtr sdo=txd sdi=cts";
  type  = serbb;
  reset = ~7;
  sck   = ~4;
  sdo   = ~3;
  sdi   = ~8;
;
@end example

Note that this uses the FT232 device as a normal serial port, not using the
FTDI drivers in the special bitbang mode.

@item
Problem: My ATtiny4/5/9/10 reads out fine, but any attempt to program
it (through TPI) fails.  Instead, the memory retains the old contents.

Solution: Mind the limited programming supply voltage range of these
devices.

In-circuit programming through TPI is only guaranteed by the datasheet
at Vcc = 5 V.

@item
Problem: My ATxmega@dots{}A1/A2/A3 cannot be programmed through PDI with
my AVR Dragon.  Programming through a JTAG ICE mkII works though, as does
programming through JTAG.

Solution: None by this time (2010 Q1).

It is said that the AVR Dragon can only program devices from the A4
Xmega sub-family.

@item
Problem: when programming with an AVRISPmkII or STK600, AVRDUDE hangs
when programming files of a certain size (e.g. 246 bytes).  Other
(larger or smaller) sizes work though.

Solution: This is a bug caused by an incorrect handling of zero-length
packets (ZLPs) in some versions of the libusb 0.1 API wrapper that ships
with libusb 1.x in certain Linux distributions.  All Linux systems with
kernel versions < 2.6.31 and libusb >= 1.0.0 < 1.0.3 are reported to be
affected by this.

@item
Problem: after flashing a firmware that reduces the target's clock
speed (e.g. through the @code{CLKPR} register), further ISP connection
attempts fail.  Or a programmer cannot initialize communication with
a brand new chip.

Solution: Even though ISP starts with pulling @var{/RESET} low, the
target continues to run at the internal clock speed either as defined by
the firmware running before or as set by the factory.  Therefore, the
ISP clock speed must be reduced appropriately (to less than 1/4 of the
internal clock speed) using the -B option before the ISP initialization
sequence will succeed.

As that slows down the entire subsequent ISP session, it might make
sense to just issue a @emph{chip erase} using the slow ISP clock
(option @code{-e}), and then start a new session at higher speed.
Option @code{-D} might be used there, to prevent another unneeded
erase cycle.

@strong{Notes}

@noindent
1. Support of 32-bit AVR (via aWire or AVT32JTAG) is experimental at best.

@noindent
2. Flash addressing above 128 KB is not supported by all programming
hardware, though most will support it.

@noindent
3. The ISP programming protocol of the AT90S1200 differs in subtle ways from
that of other AVRs.  Thus, not all ISP programmers support this device.
Known to work are all direct bitbang programmers, and all programmers
talking the STK500v2 protocol.

@noindent
4. Not all programmers can serve all memories that a part has.
Bootloader can never write to fuses, for example.

ATmega(64|128|256|644|1284|2564)RFR2, have a usersig memory. Usersig is
different to flash in the sense that it can neither be accessed with ISP
serial programming nor written to by bootloaders. AVRDUDE offers JTAG
programming of classic-part usersig memories. As with all flash-type
memories the @code{-U} option can only write 0-bits but not 1-bits.
Hence, usersig needs to be erased before a file can be written to this
memory region, e.g., using @code{-T "erase usersig" -U
usersig:w:parameters.hex:i}
