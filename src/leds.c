/*
 * Handle LEDs for some programmers
 *
 * Some hardware programmers have LEDs, and the firmware controls them
 * fully without AVRDUDE having a way to influence the LED states. Other
 * programmers have LEDs and expect the host downloader/uploader to handle
 * them. For the latter type of programmers AVRDUDE provides support of
 * four LEDs (RDY, ERR, PGM and VFY) which can be set via corresponding
 * pgm->xxx_led(pgm, on_off) calls.
 *
 * The RDY LED is set once the programmer is initialised and switched
 * off when AVRDUDE exits. During reading, writing or erasing the target
 * the PGM LED flashes with around 2.5 Hz, whilst the VFY LED comes on
 * during -U verification of the uploaded contents. Errors are indicated
 * with the ERR LED.
 *
 * Assuming AVRDUDE got to the point where LEDs are accessible and the RDY
 * LED was switched on then, on exit, AVRDUDE will leave the LEDs in the
 * following states:
 *
 * | PGM | VFY | ERR | Semantics                                        |
 * | --- | --- | --- | ------------------------------------------------ |
 * | off | off | off | OK: all tasks done without errors                |
 * | off | off | on  | Some error not related to read/write/erase       |
 * | on  | off | on  | Read/write/erase error                           |
 * | off | on  | on  | Verification error but no read/write/erase error |
 * | on  | on  | on  | Read/write/erase error and verification error    |
 *
 * Other combinations should not show after exit.
