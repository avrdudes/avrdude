	* main.c:
	  Don't call exit() directly here - set the exit value and jump to the
	  main_exit: label to ensure the programmer is released correctly.

	* stk500v2.c:
	  The stk500v2_getsync() function was improperly checking for success,
	  thus it was falsely reporting that it failed when it was actually
	  working correctly.  Fixed.

2005-07-25  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* usb_libusb.c: Catch benign errors when reading the serial #.

2005-06-19  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* Makefile.am: Implement libusb-base USB transport for the
	JTAG ICE mkII.

2005-06-11  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* avrdude.conf.in: Add support for the ATmega329x/649x.

2005-05-27  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* jtagmkII.c: fix a signedness bug when shifting bits; when
	discarding a packet for being overly long, restart the state
	machine instead of attempting to drop a preposterous amount
	of data.

2005-05-19  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* avrdude.1:
	* doc/avrdude.texi: Document that the JTAG ICE mkII code currently
	cannot write to flash one byte at a time.  Also mention the bug
	tracker interface on savannah.

	* doc/avrdude.texi:

	Mega-commit to bring in both, the STK500v2 support from Erik
	Walthinsen, as well as JTAG ICE mkII support (by me).

	Note that for the JTAG ICE, I did change a few things in the
	internal API.  Notably I made the serial receive timeout
	configurable by the backends via an exported variable (done in
	both the Posix and the Win32 implementation), and I made the
	serial_recv() function return a -1 instead of bailing out with
	exit(1) upon encountering a receive timeout (currently only done
	in the Posix implementation).  Both measures together allow me to
	receive a datastreem from the ICE at 115 kbps on a somewhat lossy
	PCI multi-UART card that occasionally drops a character.  The JTAG
	ICE mkII protocol has enough of safety layers to allow recovering
	from these events, but the previous code wasn't prepared for any
	kind of recovery.  The Win32 change for this still has to be done.

2005/02/11  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* main.c:
	  Exit non-zero if safe-mode reverts fuse bits that were requested on
	  the command-line.

	  Variable declarations must only appear at the beginning of a block.

2005/02/10  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* avrdude.1:
	  Document -u option to disable safe mode.

2005/02/10  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* configure.ac:
	  doc/Makefile is now dependent on whether or not doc is enabled.

2005/02/10  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac:
	  Disable the doc build by default; the tools needed to build
	  doc are either not available on all systems or are at best
	  inconvenient to build and install.  The doc can still be built, one
	  just needs to specify --enable-doc at configure time.
	

2005-01-24  Colin O'Flynn  <coflynn@newae.com>

	* main.c: Add "safe mode". Fuse settings will be restored at the end
	of a programming session unless the -u switch is specified.
	* safemode.c: New file. Safe mode support.
	* safemode.h: New file. Safe mode support.
	* Makefile.am: Add new files.
	* doc/avrdude.texi: Document new Safe Mode feature and switch.

2004/12/22  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* avrdude.conf.in:
	  Add support for "Xilinx JTAG cable". Contributed by:
	  Tymm <tymm@booyaka.com>

	  Add support for the AT90CAN128.  Not sure if all the instruction
	  encoding is correct, specifically the address bits don't exactly match
	  those of the preliminary datasheet that I have, but I don't see how
	  they could be right.  Tested with STK500 and it works there.
	  Instruction encodings have not been tested due to lack of a parallel
	  port on my Mac development box.

2004-07-19  Theodore A. Roth  <troth@openavr.org>

	* avrdude.1: Remove reference to ppi programmer schematic.

2004-05-19  Brian S. Dean  <bsd@bsdhome.com>

	* main.c:
	* stk500.c: Allow the baud rate to be specified on the command
	line with a new -b switch.  The specified baud rate will
	override the default serial port baud rate for a particular
	programmer.

	* ppi.c: Stub-out the ppi_* functions in ppi.c with empty
	wrappers that simply return an error code in order to build
	successfully on MacOS X.  This allows avrdude to work on MacOS
	X and was tested using a USB<->RS232 cable adapter,
	specifically Keyspan model USA-19HS.

2004-04-23  Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

	* lists.h, lists.c: Drop LISTSZ and the check for
	it in lcreat().

	from avr910, butterfly and stk500.
	* pgm.c: Fixed wrong type for default_open introduced by
	the cleanup yesterday.

2004-01-29  Jan-Hinnerk Reichert  <hinni@despammed.com>

	This change should increase immunity to delays in the
	programmer-hardware.
	Also did some unrelated cleanup in par_txrx().

2004-01-28  Jan-Hinnerk Reichert  <hinni@despammed.com>

	* pgm.[ch], main.c, par.c, avr910.c, butterfly.c, stk500.c:
